  abstract = {Recently, we demonstrated that combining joint recovery
                  with low-cost non-replicated randomized sampling
                  tailored to time-lapse seismic can give us access to
                  high fidelity, highly repeatable, dense prestack
                  vintages, and high-grade time-lapse. To arrive at
                  this result, we assumed well-calibrated
                  surveys---i.e., we presumed accurate post-plot
                  source/receiver positions. Unfortunately, in
                  practice seismic surveys are prone to calibration
                  errors, which are unknown deviations between actual
                  and post-plot acquisition geometry. By means of
                  synthetic experiments, we analyze the possible
                  impact of these errors on vintages and on time-lapse
                  data obtained with our joint recovery model from
                  compressively sampled surveys. Supported by these
                  experiments, we demonstrate that highly repeatable
                  time-lapse vintages are attainable despite the
                  presence of unknown calibration errors in the
                  positions of the shots. We assess the repeatability
                  quantitatively for two scenarios by studying the
                  impact of calibration errors on conventional dense
                  but irregularly sampled surveys and on low-cost
                  compressed surveys. To separate time-lapse effects
                  from calibration issues, we consider the idealized
                  case where the subsurface remains unchanged and the
                  practical situation where time-lapse changes are
                  restricted to a subset of the data. In both cases,
                  the quality of the recovered vintages and time-lapse
                  decreases gracefully for low-cost compressed surveys
                  with increasing calibration errors. Conversely, the
                  quality of vintages from expensive densely
                  periodically sampled surveys decreases more rapidly
                  as unknown and difficult to control calibration
                  errors increase.},

  number = {8},

  abstract = {Most conventional 3D time-lapse (or 4D) acquisitions are
                  ocean-bottom cable (OBC) or ocean-bottom node (OBN)
                  surveys since these surveys are relatively easy to
                  replicate compared to towed-streamer surveys. To
                  attain high degrees of repeatability, survey
                  replicability and dense periodic sampling has become
                  the norm for 4D surveys that renders this technology
                  expensive. Conventional towed-streamer acquisitions
                  suffer from limited illumination of subsurface due
                  to narrow azimuth. Although, acquisition techniques
                  such as multi-azimuth, wide-azimuth, rich-azimuth
                  acquisition, etc., have been developed to illuminate
                  the subsurface from all possible angles, these
                  techniques can be prohibitively expensive for
                  densely sampled surveys. This leads to uneven
                  sampling, i.e., dense receiver and coarse source
                  sampling or vice-versa, in order to make these
                  acquisitions more affordable. Motivated by the
                  design principles of Compressive Sensing (CS), we
                  acquire economic, randomly subsampled (or
                  compressive) and simultaneous towed-streamer
                  time-lapse data without the need of replicating the
                  surveys. We recover densely sampled time-lapse data
                  on one and the same periodic grid by using a
                  joint-recovery model (JRM) that exploits shared
                  information among different time-lapse recordings,
                  coupled with a computationally cheap and scalable
                  rank-minimization technique. The acquisition is low
                  cost since we have subsampled measurements (about
                  70\% subsampled), simulated with a simultaneous
                  long-offset acquisition configuration of two source
                  vessels travelling across a survey area at random
                  azimuths. We analyze the performance of our proposed
                  compressive acquisition and subsequent recovery
                  strategy by conducting a synthetic, at scale,
                  seismic experiment on a 3D time-lapse model
                  containing geological features such as channel
                  systems, dipping and faulted beds, unconformities
                  and a gas cloud. Our findings indicate that the
                  insistence on replicability between surveys and the
                  need for OBC/OBN 4D surveys can, perhaps, be
                  relaxed. Moreover, this is a natural next step
                  beyond the successful CS acquisition examples
                  discussed in this special issue.},

  title = {Beating level-set methods for {5D} seismic data interpolation: a primal-dual alternating approach},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging},
  year = {2017},
  month = {04},
  abstract = {Acquisition cost is a crucial bottleneck for seismic
                  workflows, and low-rank formulations for data
                  interpolation allow practitioners to 'fill in' data
                  volumes from critically subsampled data acquired in
                  the field. Tremendous size of seismic data volumes
                  required for seismic processing remains a major
                  challenge for these techniques. Residual-constrained
                  formulations require less parameter tuning when the
                  target noise floor is known. We propose a new
                  approach to solve residual constrained formulations
                  for interpolation. We represent the data volume in a
                  compressed manner using low-rank matrix factors, and
                  build a block-coordinate algorithm with constrained
                  convex subproblems that are solved with a
                  primal-dual splitting scheme. The develop
                  optimization framework works on the whole seismic
                  temporal frequency slices and does not require
                  windowing or non-trivial sorting of seismic
                  data. The new approach is competitive with state of
                  the art level-set algorithms that interchange the
                  role of objectives with constraints. We use the new
                  algorithm to successfully interpolate a large scale
                  5D seismic data volume (upto 1010 data-points),
                  generated from the geologically complex synthetic 3D
                  Compass velocity model, where 80\% of the data has
                  been removed. We also develop a robust extension of
                  the primal-dual approach to deal with the outliers
                  (or noise) in the data.},

  abstract = {The life-cycle of a partial differential equation (PDE)
                  solver is often characterized by three development
                  phases: the development of a stable numerical
                  discretization; development of a correct (verified)
                  implementation; and the optimization of the
                  implementation for different computer
                  architectures. Often it is only after significant
                  time and effort has been invested that the
                  performance bottlenecks of a PDE solver are fully
                  understood, and the precise details varies between
                  different computer architectures. One way to
                  mitigate this issue is to establish a reliable
                  performance model that allows a numerical analyst to
                  make reliable predictions of how well a numerical
                  method would perform on a given computer
                  architecture, before embarking upon potentially long
                  and expensive implementation and optimization
                  phases. The availability of a reliable performance
                  model also saves developer effort as it both informs
                  the developer on what kind of optimisations are
                  beneficial, and when the maximum expected
                  performance has been reached and optimisation work
                  should stop. We show how discretization of a
                  wave-equation can be theoretically studied to
                  understand the performance limitations of the method
                  on modern computer architectures. We focus on the
                  roofline model, now broadly used in the
                  high-performance computing community, which
                  considers the achievable performance in terms of the
                  peak memory bandwidth and peak floating point
                  performance of a computer with respect to
                  algorithmic choices. A first principles analysis of
                  operational intensity for key time-stepping
                  finite-difference algorithms is presented. With this
                  information available at the time of algorithm
                  design, the expected performance on target computer
                  systems can be used as a driver for algorithm
                  design. },

  abstract = {Time-lapse seismic is a powerful technology for
                  monitoring a variety of subsurface changes due to
                  reservoir fluid flow. However, the practice can be
                  technically challenging when one seeks to acquire
                  colocated time-lapse surveys with high degrees of
                  replicability among the shot locations. We have
                  determined that under "ideal" circumstances, in
                  which we ignore errors related to taking
                  measurements off the grid, high-quality prestack
                  data can be obtained from randomized subsampled
                  measurements that are observed from surveys in which
                  we choose not to revisit the same randomly
                  subsampled on-the-grid shot locations. Our
                  acquisition is low cost because our measurements are
                  subsampled. We have found that the recovered finely
                  sampled prestack baseline and monitor data actually
                  improve significantly when the same on-the-grid shot
                  locations are not revisited. We achieve this result
                  by using the fact that different time-lapse data
                  share information and that nonreplicated
                  (on-the-grid) acquisitions can add information when
                  prestack data are recovered jointly. Whenever the
                  time-lapse data exhibit joint structure---i.e., they
                  are compressible in some transform domain and share
                  information---sparsity-promoting recovery of the
                  "common component" and "innovations," with respect
                  to this common component, outperforms independent
                  recovery of the prestack baseline and monitor
                  data. The recovered time-lapse data are of high
                  enough quality to serve as the input to extract
                  poststack attributes used to compute time-lapse
                  differences. Without joint recovery, artifacts---due
                  to the randomized subsampling---lead to
                  deterioration of the degree of repeatability of the
                  time-lapse data. We tested this method by carrying
                  out experiments with reliable statistics from
                  thousands of repeated experiments. We also confirmed
                  that high degrees of repeatability are achievable
                  for an ocean-bottom cable survey acquired with
                  time-jittered continuous recording.},

                  geologic areas. Even when provided with an accurate
                  starting model, the inversion algorithms often
                  struggle to update the velocity model. Compared with
                  other areas in applied geophysics, including prior
                  information in full-waveform inversion is still in
                  its relative infancy. In part, this is due to the
                  fact that it is difficult to incorporate prior
                  information that relates to geologic settings where
                  strong discontinuities in the velocity model
                  dominate, because these settings call for nonsmooth
                  regularizations. We tackle this problem by including
                  constraints on the spatial variations and value
                  ranges of the inverted velocities, as opposed to
                  adding penalties to the objective, which is more
                  customary in mainstream geophysical inversion. By
                  demonstrating the lack of predictability of
                  edge-preserving inversion when the regularization is
                  in the form of an added penalty term, we advocate
                  the inclusion of constraints instead. Our examples
                  show that the latter leads to more predictable
                  results and to significant improvements in the
                  delineation of salt bodies when these constraints
                  are relaxed gradually in combination with extending
                  the search space to approximately fit the observed
                  data but not the noise.},

                  and receivers is inevitable in field seismic
                  acquisitions. Consequently, time-lapse surveys
                  become particularly expensive since current
                  practices aim to replicate densely sampled surveys
                  for monitoring changes occurring in the reservoir
                  due to hydrocarbon production. We demonstrate that
                  under certain circumstances, high-quality prestack
                  data can be obtained from cheap randomized
                  subsampled measurements that are observed from
                  nonreplicated surveys. We extend our time-jittered
                  marine acquisition to time-lapse surveys by
                  designing acquisition on irregular spatial grids
                  that render simultaneous, subsampled and irregular
                  measurements. Using the fact that different
                  time-lapse data share information and that
                  nonreplicated surveys add information when prestack
                  data are recovered jointly, we recover periodic
                  densely sampled and colocated prestack data by
                  adapting the recovery method to incorporate a
                  regularization operator that maps traces from an
                  irregular spatial grid to a regular periodic
                  grid. The recovery method is, therefore, a combined
                  operation of regularization, interpolation
                  (estimating missing fine-grid traces from subsampled
                  coarse-grid data), and source separation (unraveling
                  overlapping shot records). By relaxing the
                  insistence on replicability between surveys, we find
                  that recovery of the time-lapse difference shows

                  compared to the "ideal" scenario of exact

                  represented as lines in the Fourier domain. However,
                  in the real-world seismic events usually have
                  curvature or amplitude variability that means their
                  Fourier transforms are no longer strictly linear,
                  but rather occupy conic regions of the Fourier
                  domain that are narrow at low frequencies, but
                  broaden at high frequencies where the effect of
                  curvature becomes more pronounced. One can consider
                  these regions as localised "signal cones". In this
                  work, we consider a space-time variable signal cone
                  to model the seismic data. The variability of the
                  signal cone is obtained through scaling, slanting
                  and translation of the kernel for cone-limited
                  (C-limited) functions (functions whose Fourier
                  transform lives within a cone) or C-Gaussian
                  function (a multivariate function whose Fourier
                  transform decays exponentially with respect to
                  slowness and frequency) which constitutes our
                  dictionary. We find a discrete number of scaling,
                  slanting and translation parameters from a continuum
                  by optimally matching the data. This is a nonlinear
                  optimization problem which we address by a fixed
                  point method which utilizes a variable projection
                  method with e1 constraints on the linear parameters
                  and bound constraints on the nonlinear
                  parameters. We observe that slow decay and
                  oscillatory behavior of the kernel for C-limited
                  functions constitute bottlenecks for the
                  optimization problem which we partially overcome by
                  the C-Gaussian function. We demonstrate our method

  abstract = {Given appropriate data acquisition, processing to remove
                  nonprimary arrivals, and use of an accurate
                  migration algorithm, it is the quality of the
                  subsurface velocity model that typically controls
                  the quality of imaging that can be obtained from
                  salt-affected seismic data. Full-waveform inversion
                  has the potential to improve the accuracy,
                  resolution, repeatability, and speed with which such
                  velocity models can be generated, but, in the
                  absence of an accurate starting model, that
                  potential is difficult to realize in
                  practice. Presented are successful inversion
                  results, obtained from synthetic subsalt models,
                  using a robust full-waveform inversion code that
                  includes constraints upon the set of allowable earth
                  models. These constraints include limitations on the
                  total variation of the velocity of the model and,
                  most significantly, on the asymmetric variation of
                  velocity with depth such that negative velocity
                  excursions are limited. During the iteration, these
                  constraints are relaxed progressively so that the
                  final model is driven principally by the seismic
                  data, but the constraints act to steer the inversion
                  path away from local minima in its early
                  stages. This methodology is applied to portions of
                  the 2004 BP benchmark and Phase I SEAM salt models,
                  recovering an accurate model of the salt body,
                  including its base and flanks, and an accurate model
                  of the subsalt velocity structure, starting from
                  one-dimensional velocity models that are severely
                  cycle skipped. This approach removes entirely the
                  requirement to pick salt boundaries from migrated
                  seismic data, and acts as a form of automatic salt
                  and sediment flooding during full-waveform

  abstract = {We propose an extended full-waveform inversion
                  formulation that includes general convex constraints

                  nonconvex, the overarching optimization scheme
                  arrives at geologically plausible results by solving
                  a sequence of relaxed and warm-started constrained
                  convex subproblems. The combination of box,
                  total-variation, and successively relaxed asymmetric
                  total-variation constraints allows us to steer free
                  from parasitic local minima while keeping the
                  estimated physical parameters laterally continuous
                  and in a physically realistic range. For accurate
                  starting models, numerical experiments carried out
                  on the challenging 2004 BP velocity benchmark
                  demonstrate that bound and total-variation
                  constraints improve the inversion result
                  significantly by removing inversion artifacts,
                  related to source encoding, and by clearly improved
                  delineation of top, bottom, and flanks of a
                  high-velocity high-contrast salt inclusion. The
                  experiments also show that for poor starting models
                  these two constraints by themselves are insufficient
                  to detect the bottom of high-velocity inclusions
                  such as salt. Inclusion of the one-sided asymmetric
                  total-variation constraint overcomes this issue by
                  discouraging velocity lows to buildup during the
                  early stages of the inversion. To the author's
                  knowledge the presented algorithm is the first to
                  successfully remove the imprint of local minima

                  near-offsets and large holes in the acquisition grid
                  which does not produce aliasing but otherwise causes
                  large errors in the multiple prediction. Exclusion
                  of the unknown data as an inversion variable from
                  the process is desirable, since it sidesteps
                  possible issues arising from fitting observations
                  that are also unknowns in the same inversion
                  problem. Instead, we simulate their multiple
                  contributions by augmenting the forward prediction
                  model for the total wavefield with a scattering
                  series that mimics the action of the free surface
                  reflector within the confines of the unobserved
                  trace locations. Each term in this scattering series
                  simply involves convolution of the predicted
                  wavefield once more with the current estimated
                  surface-free Green's function at these unobserved
                  locations. We investigate the necessary
                  modifications to the primary estimation algorithm to
                  account for the resulting nonlinearity in the
                  modeling operator, and also demonstrate that just a
                  few scattering terms are enough to satisfactorily
                  mitigate the effects of near-offset data gaps during
                  the inversion process. Numerical experiments on
                  synthetic data show that the final derived method
                  can significantly outperform explicit data
                  reconstruction for large near-offset gaps. This is
                  achieved with a similar computational cost and
                  better memory efficiency compared to explicit data
                  reconstruction. We also show on real data that our
                  scheme outperforms pre-interpolation of the

                  least-squares optimization problem. This non-convex
                  problem can be extremely computationally expensive
                  because it requires repeatedly solving large linear
                  systems that correspond to discretized partial
                  differential equations. Randomized subsampling
                  techniques allow us to work with small subsets of
                  (monochromatic) source experiments, reducing the
                  computational cost. However, this subsampling
                  weakens subsurface illumination and introduces
                  subsampling related incoherent artifacts. These
                  subsampling-related artifacts---in conjunction with
                  local minima that are known to plague full-waveform
                  inversion---motivate us to come up with a technique
                  to "regularize" this problem. Following earlier
                  work, we take advantage of the fact that curvelets
                  represent subsurface models and perturbations
                  parsimoniously. At first impulse promoting sparsity
                  on the model directly seems the most natural way to
                  proceed, but we will demonstrate that in certain
                  cases it can be advantageous to promote sparsity on
                  the Gauss-Newton updates instead. While constraining
                  the one-norm of the descent directions does not
                  change not change the underlying full-waveform
                  inversion objective, the constrained model updates
                  remain descent directions, remove
                  subsampling-related artifacts and improve the
                  overall inversion result. We empirically observe
                  this phenomenon in situations where the different
                  model updates occur at roughly the same locations in
                  the curvelet domain. We further investigate and
                  analyze this phenomenon, where nonlinear inversions
                  benefit from sparsity-promoting constraints on the
                  updates, by means of a set of carefully selected
                  examples including phase retrieval and full-waveform
                  inversion. In all cases, we observe a faster decay
                  of the residual and model error as a function of the
                  number of iterations.},

                  sampling a smooth function on a regular (or
                  structured) grid. However, in many practical
                  situations the measurements are taken on an
                  irregular grid (that is accurately known). This
                  results in an "unstructured data matrix" that is

  abstract = {We address the problem of obtaining a reliable seismic
                  image without prior knowledge of the source wavelet,
                  especially from data that contain strong
                  surface-related multiples. Conventional reverse-time
                  migration requires prior knowledge of the source
                  wavelet, which is either technically or
                  computationally challenging to accurately determine;
                  inaccurate estimates of the source wavelet can
                  result in seriously degraded reverse-time migrated
                  images, and therefore wrong geological
                  interpretations. To solve this problem, we present a
                  "wavelet-free" imaging procedure that simultaneously
                  inverts for the source wavelet and the seismic
                  image, by tightly integrating source estimation into
                  a fast least-squares imaging framework, namely
                  compressive imaging, given a reasonably accurate
                  background velocity model. However, this joint
                  inversion problem is difficult to solve as it is
                  plagued with local minima and the ambiguity with
                  respect to amplitude scalings because of the
                  multiplicative, and therefore nonlinear, appearance
                  of the source wavelet in the otherwise linear
                  formalism. We have found a way to solve this
                  nonlinear joint-inversion problem using a technique
                  called variable projection, and a way to overcome
                  the scaling ambiguity by including surface-related
                  multiples in our imaging procedure following recent
                  developments in surface-related multiple prediction
                  by sparse inversion. As a result, we obtain without
                  prior knowledge of the source wavelet
                  high-resolution seismic images, comparable in
                  quality to images obtained assuming the true source
                  wavelet is known. By leveraging the computationally
                  efficient compressive-imaging methodology, these
                  results are obtained at affordable computational
                  costs compared with conventional processing work
                  flows that include surface-related multiple removal
                  and reverse-time migration.},

  abstract = {Image gathers as a function of subsurface offset are an
                  important tool for the inference of rock properties
                  and velocity analysis in areas of complex
                  geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of
                  as multidimensional correlations of the source and
                  receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing
                  these gathers lies in the fact that one needs to
                  store, compute, and correlate these wavefields for
                  all shots in order to obtain the desired image
                  gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically
                  only computed for a limited number of subsurface
                  points and for a limited range of subsurface
                  offsets, which may cause problems in complex
                  geological areas with large geologic dips. We
                  overcome increasing computational and storage costs
                  of extended image volumes by introducing a
                  formulation that avoids explicit storage and removes
                  the customary and expensive loop over shots found in
                  conventional extended imaging. As a result, we end
                  up with a matrix–vector formulation from which
                  different image gathers can be formed and with which
                  amplitude-versus-angle and wave-equation migration
                  velocity analysis can be performed without requiring
                  prior information on the geologic dips. Aside from
                  demonstrating the formation of two-way extended
                  image gathers for different purposes and at greatly
                  reduced costs, we also present a new approach to
                  conduct automatic wave-equation-based
                  migration-velocity analysis. Instead of focusing in
                  particular offset directions and preselected subsets
                  of subsurface points, our method focuses every
                  subsurface point for all subsurface offset
                  directions using a randomized probing technique. As
                  a consequence, we obtain good velocity models at low
                  cost for complex models without the need to provide
                  information on the geologic dips.},

                  problems whose solutions are well-approximated by
                  Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensors, an efficient
                  structured tensor format based on recursive subspace
                  factorizations. By exploiting the smooth manifold
                  structure of these tensors, we construct standard
                  optimization algorithms such as Steepest Descent and
                  Conjugate Gradient for completing tensors from
                  missing entries. Our algorithmic framework is fast
                  and scalable to large problem sizes as we do not
                  require SVDs on the ambient tensor space, as
                  required by other methods. Moreover, we exploit the
                  structure of the Gramian matrices associated with
                  the HT format to regularize our problem, reducing
                  overfitting for high subsampling ratios. We also

                  major impact on completion from realistic seismic
                  acquisition geometries. These samplings are far from
                  idealized randomized samplings that are usually

  abstract = {Despite recent developments in improved acquisition,
                  seismic data often remain undersampled along source
                  and receiver coordinates, resulting in incomplete
                  data for key applications such as migration and
                  multiple prediction. We have interpreted the
                  missing-trace interpolation problem in the context
                  of matrix completion (MC), and developed three
                  practical principles for using low-rank optimization
                  techniques to recover seismic data. Specifically, we
                  strive for recovery scenarios wherein the original
                  signal is low rank and the subsampling scheme
                  increases the singular values of the matrix. We use
                  an optimization program that restores this low-rank
                  structure to recover the full volume. Omitting one
                  or more of these principles can lead to poor
                  interpolation results, as we found
                  experimentally. In light of this theory, we
                  compensate for the high-rank behavior of data in the
                  source-receiver domain by using the midpoint-offset
                  transformation for 2D data and a source-receiver
                  permutation for 3D data to reduce the overall
                  singular values. Simultaneously, to work with
                  computationally feasible algorithms for large-scale
                  data, we use a factorization-based approach to MC,
                  which significantly speeds up the computations
                  compared with repeated singular value decompositions
                  without reducing the recovery quality. In the
                  context of our theory and experiments, we also find
                  that windowing the data too aggressively can have
                  adverse effects on the recovery quality. To overcome
                  this problem, we carried out our interpolations for
                  each frequency independently while working with the
                  entire frequency slice. The result is a
                  computationally efficient, theoretically motivated
                  framework for interpolating missing-trace data. Our
                  tests on realistic 2D and 3D seismic data sets show
                  that our method compares favorably in terms of
                  computational speed and recovery quality with
                  existing curvelet- and tensor-based techniques.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous marine acquisition is an economic way to
                  sample seismic data and speed up acquisition,
                  wherein single or multiple source vessels fire
                  sources at near-simultaneous or slightly random
                  times, resulting in overlapping shot records. The
                  current paradigm for simultaneous towed-streamer
                  marine acquisition incorporates “low variability” in
                  source firing times, i.e., 0 ≤ 1 or 2 s because the
                  sources and receivers are moving. This results in a
                  low degree of randomness in simultaneous data, which
                  is challenging to separate (into its constituent
                  sources) using compressed-sensing-based separation
                  techniques because randomization is key to
                  successful recovery via compressed sensing. We have
                  addressed the challenge of source separation for
                  simultaneous towed-streamer acquisitions via two
                  compressed-sensing-based approaches, i.e., sparsity
                  promotion and rank minimization. We have evaluated
                  the performance of the sparsity-promotion- and
                  rank-minimization-based techniques by simulating two
                  simultaneous towed-streamer acquisition scenarios,
                  i.e., over/under and simultaneous long offset. A
                  field data example from the Gulf of Suez for the
                  over/under acquisition scenario was also
                  developed. We observed that the proposed approaches
                  gave good and comparable recovery qualities of the
                  separated sources, but the rank-minimization
                  technique outperformed the sparsity-promoting
                  technique in terms of the computational time and
                  memory. We also compared these two techniques with
                  the normal-moveout-based median-filtering-type
                  approach, which had comparable results.},

  abstract = {In marine exploration seismology, surface-related
                  multiples are usually treated as noise mainly
                  because subsequent processing steps, such as
                  migration velocity analysis and imaging, require
                  multiple-free data. Failure to remove these
                  wavefield components from the data may lead to
                  erroneous estimates for migration velocity or result
                  in strong coherent artefacts that interfere with the
                  imaged reflectors. However, multiples can carry
                  complementary information compared to primaries, as
                  they interact with the free surface and are
                  therefore exposed more to the subsurface. Recent
                  work has shown that when processed correctly
                  multiples can improve seismic illumination. Given a
                  sufficiently accurate background velocity model and
                  an estimate for the source signature, we propose a
                  new and computationally efficient linearized
                  inversion procedure based on two-way wave equations,
                  which produces accurate images of the subsurface
                  from the total upgoing wavefield including
                  surface-related multiples. Modelling of the
                  surface-related multiples in the proposed method
                  derives from the well-known surface-related multiple
                  elimination method. We incur a minimal overhead from
                  incorporating the multiples by having the
                  wave-equation solver carry out the multiple
                  predictions via the inclusion of an areal source
                  instead of expensive dense matrix-matrix
                  multiplications. By using subsampling techniques, we
                  obtain high-quality true-amplitude least-squares
                  migrated images at computational costs of roughly a
                  single reverse-time migration (RTM) with all the
                  data. These images are virtually free of coherent
                  artefacts from multiples. Proper inversion of the
                  multiples would be computationally infeasible
                  without using these techniques that significantly
                  bring down the cost. By promoting sparsity in the
                  curvelet domain and using rerandomization, out
                  method gains improved robustness to errors in the
                  background velocity model, and errors incurred in
                  the linearization of the wave equation with respect
                  to the model. We demonstrate the superior
                  performance of the proposed method compared to the
                  conventional RTM using realistic synthetic
                  examples.},

  abstract = {In marine seismic acquisition, surface-related multiples
                  constitute a significant portion of the acquired
                  data. Typically, multiples are removed during
                  early-stage data-processing as they can lead to
                  phantom reflectors during migration that may result
                  in erroneous geological interpretations. However, if
                  properly dealt with, multiples can provide valuable
                  extra information and complement primaries in
                  illuminating the subsurface. In this article, we
                  demonstrate the limitation of the reverse-time
                  migration in imaging these multiples, and present an
                  alternative inversion procedure that is
                  computationally efficient, that jointly maps both
                  primaries and multiples to the true reflectors, and
                  where the source function is estimated on the
                  fly. As a result, we obtain high-quality, mostly
                  artifact-free, broad-band images where the imprint
                  of the source-function are partly removed at a
                  computationally affordable expense compared to the
                  combined costs of the wave-equation based
                  surface-related multiple elimination and the
                  reverse-time migration. We achieve all this by

                  We apply the proposed method to a shallow-water

                  artifacts associated with these multiples. We also
                  demonstrate the benefits of joint imaging of
                  primaries and multiples compared to imaging these
                  signal components separately.},

  abstract = {Many inverse and parameter estimation problems can be
                  written as PDE-constrained optimization
                  problems. The goal is to infer the parameters,
                  typically coefficients of the PDE, from partial
                  measurements of the solutions of the PDE for several
                  right-hand sides. Such PDE-constrained problems can
                  be solved by finding a stationary point of the
                  Lagrangian, which entails simultaneously updating
                  the parameters and the (adjoint) state
                  variables. For large-scale problems, such an
                  all-at-once approach is not feasible as it requires
                  storing all the state variables. In this case one
                  usually resorts to a reduced approach where the
                  constraints are explicitly eliminated (at each
                  iteration) by solving the PDEs. These two
                  approaches, and variations thereof, are the main
                  workhorses for solving PDE-constrained optimization
                  problems arising from inverse problems. In this
                  paper, we present an alternative method that aims to
                  combine the advantages of both approaches. Our
                  method is based on a quadratic penalty formulation
                  of the constrained optimization problem. By
                  eliminating the state variable, we develop an
                  efficient algorithm that has roughly the same
                  computational complexity as the conventional reduced
                  approach while exploiting a larger search
                  space. Numerical results show that this method
                  indeed reduces some of the nonlinearity of the
                  problem and is less sensitive to the initial
                  iterate.},

  abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion aims at obtaining detailed
                  estimates of subsurface medium parameters, such as
                  the spatial distribution of soundspeed, from
                  multiexperiment seismic data. A formulation of this
                  inverse problem in the frequency domain leads to an
                  optimization problem constrained by a Helmholtz
                  equation with many right-hand sides. Application of
                  this technique to industry-scale problems faces
                  several challenges: First, we need to solve the
                  Helmholtz equation for high wave numbers over large
                  computational domains. Second, the data consist of
                  many independent experiments, leading to a large
                  number of PDE solves. This results in high
                  computational complexity both in terms of memory and
                  CPU time as well as input/output costs. Finally, the
                  inverse problem is highly nonlinear and a lot of art
                  goes into preprocessing and regularization. Ideally,
                  an inversion needs to be run several times with
                  different initial guesses and/or tuning
                  parameters. In this paper, we discuss the
                  requirements of the various components (PDE solver,
                  optimization method, \dots) when applied to
                  large-scale three-dimensional seismic waveform
                  inversion and combine several existing approaches
                  into a flexible inversion scheme for seismic
                  waveform inversion. The scheme is based on the idea
                  that in the early stages of the inversion we do not
                  need all the data or very accurate PDE solves. We
                  base our method on an existing preconditioned Krylov
                  solver (CARP-CG) and use ideas from stochastic
                  optimization to formulate a gradient-based
                  (quasi-Newton) optimization algorithm that works
                  with small subsets of the right-hand sides and uses
                  inexact PDE solves for the gradient calculations. We
                  propose novel heuristics to adaptively control both
                  the accuracy and the number of right-hand sides. We
                  illustrate the algorithms on synthetic benchmark
                  models for which significant computational gains can
                  be made without being sensitive to noise and without
                  losing the accuracy of the inverted model.},

  abstract = {Recent SVD-free matrix factorization formulations have
                  enabled rank minimization for systems with millions
                  of rows and columns, paving the way for matrix
                  completion in extremely large-scale applications,
                  such as seismic data interpolation. In this paper,
                  we consider matrix completion formulations designed
                  to hit a target data-fitting error level provided by
                  the user, and we propose an algorithm called LR-BPDN
                  that is able to exploit factorized formulations to
                  solve the corresponding optimization problem. Since
                  practitioners typically have strong prior knowledge
                  about target error level, this innovation makes it
                  easy to apply the algorithm in practice, leaving
                  only the factor rank to be determined. Within the
                  established framework, we propose two extensions
                  that are highly relevant to solving practical
                  challenges of data interpolation. First, we propose
                  a weighted extension that allows known subspace
                  information to improve the results of matrix
                  completion formulations. We show how this weighting
                  can be used in the context of frequency
                  continuation, an essential aspect to seismic data
                  interpolation. Second, we propose matrix completion
                  formulations that are robust to large measurement
                  errors in the available data. We illustrate the
                  advantages of LR-BPDN on collaborative filtering
                  problems using the MovieLens 1M and 10M and Netflix
                  100M datasets. Then we use the new method, along
                  with its robust and subspace reweighted extensions,
                  to obtain high-quality reconstructions for
                  large-scale seismic interpolation problems with real
                  data, even in the presence of data contamination.},

  abstract = {Wave-equation based methods, such as the estimation of
                  primaries by sparse inversion, have been successful
                  in the mitigation of the adverse effects of
                  surface-related multiples on seismic imaging and
                  migration-velocity analysis. However, the reliance
                  of these methods on multidimensional convolutions
                  with fully sampled data exposes the ‘curse of
                  dimensionality’, which leads to disproportional
                  growth in computational and storage demands when
                  moving to realistic 3D field data. To remove this
                  fundamental impediment, we propose a
                  dimensionality-reduction technique where the ‘data
                  matrix’ is approximated adaptively by a randomized
                  low-rank factorization. Compared to conventional
                  methods, which need for each iteration passage
                  through all data possibly requiring on-the-fly
                  interpolation, our randomized approach has the
                  advantage that the total number of passes is reduced
                  to only one to three. In addition, the low-rank
                  matrix factorization leads to considerable
                  reductions in storage and computational costs of the
                  matrix multiplies required by the sparse
                  inversion. Application of the proposed method to
                  two-dimensional synthetic and real data shows that
                  significant performance improvements in speed and
                  memory use are achievable at a low computational
                  up-front cost required by the low-rank

  abstract = {Wave equation based inversions, such as full-waveform
                  inversion and reverse-time migration, are
                  challenging because of their computational costs,
                  memory requirements and reliance on accurate initial
                  models. To confront these issues, we propose a novel
                  formulation of wave equation based inversion based
                  on a penalty method. In this formulation, the
                  objective function consists of a data-misfit term
                  and a penalty term, which measures how accurately
                  the wavefields satisfy the wave equation. This new
                  approach is a major departure from current
                  formulations where forward and adjoint wavefields,
                  which both satisfy the wave equation, are correlated
                  to compute updates for the unknown model
                  parameters. Instead, we carry out the inversions
                  over two alternating steps during which we first
                  estimate the wavefield everywhere, given the current
                  model parameters, source and observed data, followed
                  by a second step during which we update the model
                  parameters, given the estimate for the wavefield
                  everywhere and the source. Because the inversion
                  involves both the synthetic wavefields and the
                  medium parameters, its search space is enlarged so
                  that it suffers less from local minima. Compared to
                  other formulations that extend the search space of
                  wave equation based inversion, our method differs in
                  several aspects, namely (i) it avoids storage and
                  updates of the synthetic wavefields because we
                  calculate these explicitly by finding solutions that
                  obey the wave equation and fit the observed data and
                  (ii) no adjoint wavefields are required to update
                  the model, instead our updates are calculated from
                  these solutions directly, which leads to significant
                  computational savings. We demonstrate the validity
                  of our approach by carefully selected examples and
                  discuss possible extensions and future research.},

                  one-norm minimization, which exploits correlations
                  between the locations of significant curvelet
                  coefficients of different partitions, e.g., shot
                  records, common-offset gathers, or frequency slices
                  of the acquired data. We use these correlations to
                  define a sequence of 2D curvelet-based recovery
                  problems that exploit 3D continuity exhibited by
                  seismic wavefields without relying on the highly
                  redundant 3D curvelet transform. To test the
                  performance of our weighted algorithm, we compared
                  recoveries from different data sorting and
                  partitioning scenarios for a seismic line from the
                  Gulf of Suez. These tests demonstrated that our
                  method is superior to standard $\ell_1$ minimization
                  in terms of antialiasing capability, reconstruction
                  quality and computational memory requirements.},

  abstract = {A recently proposed method called estimation of
                  primaries by sparse inversion (EPSI) avoids the need
                  for adaptive subtraction of approximate multiple
                  predictions by directly inverting for the
                  multiple-free subsurface impulse response as a
                  collection of band-limited spikes. Although it can
                  be shown that the correct primary impulse response
                  is obtained through the sparsest possible solution,
                  the original EPSI algorithm was not designed to take
                  advantage of this result, and instead it relies on a
                  multitude of inversion parameters, such as the level
                  of sparsity per gradient update. We proposed and
                  tested a new algorithm, named robust EPSI, in which
                  we make obtaining the sparsest solution an explicit
                  goal. Our approach remains a gradient-based approach
                  like the original algorithm, but it is derived from
                  a new biconvex optimization framework based on an
                  extended basis-pursuit denoising
                  formulation. Furthermore, because it is based on a
                  general framework, robust EPSI can recover the
                  impulse response in transform domains, such as
                  sparsifying curvelet-based representations, without
                  changing the underlying algorithm. We discovered
                  that the sparsity-minimizing objective of our
                  formulation enabled it to operate successfully on a
                  variety of synthetic and field marine data sets
                  without excessive tweaking of inversion
                  parameters. We also found that recovering the
                  solution in alternate sparsity domains can
                  significantly improve the quality of the directly
                  estimated primaries, especially for weaker
                  late-arrival events. In addition, we found that
                  robust EPSI produces a more artifact-free impulse
                  response compared to the original algorithm.},

                  from incomplete acquired seismic
                  recordings. Curvelet-based Recovery by
                  Sparsity-promoting Inversion, adapted from the
                  recently-developed theory of compressive sensing, is
                  one such kind of reconstruction, especially good for
                  recovery of undersampled seismic data. Like
                  traditional Fourier-based methods, it performs best
                  when used in conjunction with randomized
                  subsampling, which converts aliases from the usual
                  regular periodic subsampling into easy-to-eliminate
                  noise. By virtue of its ability to control gap size,
                  along with the random and irregular nature of its
                  sampling pattern, jittered (sub)sampling is one
                  proven method that has been used successfully for
                  the determination of geophone positions along a
                  seismic line. In this paper, we extend jittered
                  sampling to two-dimensional acquisition design, a
                  more difficult problem, with both underlying
                  Cartesian, and hexagonal grids. We also study what
                  we term separable and non-separable two-dimensional
                  jittered samplings. We find hexagonal jittered
                  sampling performs better than Cartesian jittered
                  sampling, while fully non-separable jittered
                  sampling performs better than separable jittered
                  sampling. Two other 2D randomized sampling methods,
                  Poisson Disk sampling and Farthest Point sampling,
                  both known to possess blue-noise spectra, are also
                  shown to perform well.},

  abstract = {Waveform inversion is the method of choice for
                  determining highly heterogeneous subsurface
                  structure. However, conventional waveform inversion
                  requires that the wavefield for each source is
                  computed separately. This makes it very expensive
                  for realistic 3D seismic surveys. Source-encoding
                  waveform inversion, in which the sources are
                  modelled simultaneously, is considerably faster than
                  conventional waveform inversion but suffers from
                  artifacts. These artifacts can partly be removed by
                  assigning random weights to the source
                  wavefields. We found that the misfit function, and
                  therefore also its gradient, for source-encoding
                  waveform inversion is an unbiased random estimation
                  of the misfit function used in conventional waveform
                  inversion. We found a new method of source-encoding
                  waveform inversion which takes into account the
                  random nature of the gradients used in the
                  optimization. In this new method, the gradient at
                  each iteration is a weighted average of past
                  gradients such that the most recent gradients have
                  the largest weights with exponential decay. This way
                  we damped the random fluctuations of the gradient by
                  incorporating information from the previous
                  iterations. We compare this new method with existing
                  source-encoding waveform inversion methods as well
                  as conventional waveform inversion and found that
                  the model misfit reduction is faster and smoother
                  than those of existing source-encoding waveform
                  inversion methods, and it approaches the model
                  misfit reduction obtained in conventional waveform
                  inversion.},

                  mapped to that level by a process called
                  interferometric redatuming. After redatuming, the
                  obtained wavefields can be used for imaging below
                  this particular depth level. Interferometric
                  redatuming consists of two steps, namely (i) the
                  decomposition of the observed wavefields into up-
                  and down-going constituents and (ii) a

                  problem. Basis pursuit denoise (BPDN) fits the
                  least-squares problem only approximately, and a
                  single parameter determines a curve that traces the
                  optimal trade-off between the least-squares fit and
                  the one-norm of the solution. We prove that this
                  curve is convex and continuously differentiable over
                  all points of interest, and show that it gives an
                  explicit relationship to two other optimization

                  recovery rate of sequential SMV using L1
                  minimization, and that there are problems that can
                  be solved with one approach but not with the
                  other. Second, we analyze the performance of the

                  recover primary parameters. Structure present in
                  these problems allows efficient optimization
                  strategies - a well known example is variable
                  projection, where nonlinear least squares problems
                  which are linear in some parameters can be very
                  efficiently optimized. In this paper, we extend the
                  idea of projecting out a subset over the variables
                  to a broad class of maximum likelihood (ML) and
                  maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) problems with

                  unexplained by the forward model. This motivates us
                  to propose a robust formulation based on the
                  Student's t-distribution of the error. We
                  demonstrate how the corresponding penalty function,
                  together with the sampling approach, can obtain good
                  results for a large-scale seismic inverse problem
                  with 50 \% corrupted data.},

                  materials by isostatically hot-pressing mixtures of
                  fine powders of calcite and quartz. The resulting
                  rocks were marbles containing varying concentrations
                  of dispersed quartz grains. Pores were present
                  throughout the rock, but the largest ones were
                  preferentially associated with the quartz particles,
                  leading us to characterize the material as being
                  composed of two phases, one with high permeability
                  and the second with low permeability. We measured
                  the permeability and storativity of these materials
                  using the oscillating flow technique, while
                  systematically varying the effective pressure and
                  the period and amplitude of the input fluid
                  oscillation. Control measurements performed using
                  the steady state flow and pulse decay techniques
                  agreed well with the oscillating flow tests. The
                  hydraulic properties of the marbles were highly
                  sensitive to the volume fraction of the
                  high-permeability phase (directly related to the
                  quartz content). Below a critical quartz content,
                  slightly less than 20 wt \%, the high-permeability
                  volume elements were disconnected, and the overall
                  permeability was low. Above the critical quartz
                  content the high-permeability volume elements formed
                  throughgoing paths, and permeability increased
                  sharply.  We numerically simulated fluid flow
                  through binary materials and found that permeability
                  approximately obeys a percolation-based mixing law,
                  consistent with the measured permeability of the

                  solutions of the original problem for all values of
                  the regularization parameter below some positive
                  threshold. For a general convex program, we show
                  that the regularization is exact if and only if a
                  certain selection problem has a Lagrange
                  multiplier. Moreover, the regularization parameter
                  threshold is inversely related to the Lagrange
                  multiplier. We use this result to generalize an
                  exact regularization result of Ferris and
                  Mangasarian [Appl. Math.  Optim., 23(1991),
                  pp. 266{\textendash}273] involving a linearized

                  necessary and sufficient conditions for exact
                  penalization, similar to those obtained by Bertsekas

                  and Optimization, Athena Scientific, Belmont, MA,

                  derive error bounds on the distance from the
                  regularized solution to the original solution
                  set. We also show that existence of a

                  regularization. We illustrate the main result with
                  numerical experiments on the l1 regularization of
                  benchmark (degenerate) linear programs and

                  sides. The computational cost and memory
                  requirements of such problems increase linearly with
                  the number of right-hand sides. For many
                  applications this is the main bottleneck of the

                  curves trace the optimal trade off between these two
                  competing aims. These curves are commonly used in
                  problems with two-norm priors where they are plotted

                  discrete curvelet transform (NFDCT) and introduce a
                  second generation of the transform. This new
                  generation differs from the previous one by the
                  approach taken to compute accurate curvelet
                  coefficients from irregularly sampled data. The
                  first generation relies on accurate Fourier
                  coefficients obtained by an l2-regularized inversion
                  of the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (FFT)
                  whereas the second is based on a direct
                  l1-regularized inversion of the operator that links
                  curvelet coefficients to irregular data. Also, by
                  construction the second generation NFDCT is lossless
                  unlike the first generation NFDCT. This property is
                  particularly attractive for processing irregularly
                  sampled seismic data in the curvelet domain and
                  bringing them back to their irregular record-ing
                  locations with high fidelity. Secondly, we combine
                  the second generation NFDCT with the standard fast
                  discrete curvelet transform (FDCT) to form a new
                  curvelet-based method, coined nonequispaced curvelet

                  (NCRSI) for the regularization and interpolation of
                  irregularly sampled data. We demonstrate that for a
                  pure regularization problem the reconstruction is
                  very accurate. The signal-to-reconstruction error
                  ratio in our example is above 40 dB. We also conduct
                  combined interpolation and regularization
                  experiments. The reconstructions for synthetic data
                  are accurate, particularly when the recording
                  locations are optimally jittered. The reconstruction
                  in our real data example shows amplitudes along the

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new discrete undersampling
                  scheme designed to favor wavefield reconstruction by
                  sparsity-promoting inversion with transform elements
                  that are localized in the Fourier domain. Our work
                  is motivated by empirical observations in the
                  seismic community, corroborated by recent results
                  from compressive sampling, which indicate favorable
                  (wavefield) reconstructions from random as opposed
                  to regular undersampling. As predicted by theory,
                  random undersampling renders coherent aliases into
                  harmless incoherent random noise, effectively
                  turning the interpolation problem into a much
                  simpler denoising problem. A practical requirement
                  of wavefield reconstruction with localized
                  sparsifying transforms is the control on the maximum
                  gap size. Unfortunately, random undersampling does
                  not provide such a control and the main purpose of
                  this paper is to introduce a sampling scheme, coined
                  jittered undersampling, that shares the benefits of
                  random sampling, while offering control on the
                  maximum gap size. Our contribution of jittered
                  sub-Nyquist sampling proves to be key in the
                  formulation of a versatile wavefield
                  sparsity-promoting recovery scheme that follows the
                  principles of compressive sampling. After studying
                  the behavior of the jittered undersampling scheme in
                  the Fourier domain, its performance is studied for
                  curvelet recovery by sparsity-promoting inversion
                  (CRSI). Our findings on synthetic and real seismic
                  data indicate an improvement of several decibels
                  over recovery from regularly-undersampled data for
                  the same amount of data collected.},

  abstract = {Many seismic exploration techniques rely on the
                  collection of massive data volumes that are
                  subsequently mined for information during
                  processing.  Although this approach has been
                  extremely successful in the past, current efforts
                  toward higher-resolution images in increasingly
                  complicated regions of the earth continue to reveal
                  fundamental shortcomings in our workflows. Chiefly
                  among these is the so-called
                  {\textquotedblleft}curse of
                  dimensionality{\textquotedblright} exemplified by
                  Nyquist{\textquoteright}s sampling criterion, which
                  disproportionately strains current acquisition and
                  processing systems as the size and desired
                  resolution of our survey areas continue to
                  increase. We offer an alternative sampling method
                  leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing
                  toward seismic acquisition and processing for data
                  that are traditionally considered to be
                  undersampled. The main outcome of this approach is a
                  new technology where acquisition and processing
                  related costs are no longer determined by overly
                  stringent sampling criteria, such as Nyquist. At the
                  heart of our approach lies randomized incoherent
                  sampling that breaks subsampling related
                  interferences by turning them into harmless noise,
                  which we subsequently remove by promoting
                  transform-domain sparsity. Now, costs no longer grow
                  significantly with resolution and dimensionality of
                  the survey area, but instead depend only on
                  transform-domain sparsity. Our contribution is
                  twofold. First, we demonstrate by means of carefully
                  designed numerical experiments that compressive
                  sensing can successfully be adapted to seismic
                  exploration.  Second, we show that accurate recovery
                  can be accomplished for compressively sampled data
                  volumes sizes that exceed the size of conventional
                  transform-domain data volumes by only a small
                  factor. Because compressive sensing combines
                  transformation and encoding by a single linear
                  encoding step, this technology is directly
                  applicable to acquisition and to dimensionality
                  reduction during processing. In either case,
                  sampling, storage, and processing costs scale with
                  transform-domain sparsity. We illustrate this
                  principle by means of number of case studies.},

  abstract = {In this paper an alternative approach to the blind
                  seismic deconvolution problem is presented that aims
                  for two goals namely recovering the location and
                  relative strength of seismic reflectors, possibly
                  with super-localization, as well as obtaining
                  detailed parametric characterizations for the
                  reflectors. We hope to accomplish these goals by
                  decomposing seismic data into a redundant dictionary
                  of parameterized waveforms designed to closely match
                  the properties of reflection events associated with
                  sedimentary records. In particular, our method
                  allows for highly intermittent non-Gaussian records
                  yielding a reflectivity that can no longer be
                  described by a stationary random process or by a
                  spike train. Instead, we propose a reflector
                  parameterization that not only recovers the
                  reflector{\textquoteright}s location and relative
                  strength but which also captures reflector
                  attributes such as its local scaling, sharpness and
                  instantaneous phase-delay. The first set of
                  parameters delineates the stratigraphy whereas the
                  second provides information on the lithology. As a
                  consequence of the redundant parameterization,
                  finding the matching waveforms from the dictionary
                  involves the solution of an ill-posed problem. Two
                  complementary sparseness-imposing methods Matching
                  and Basis Pursuit are compared for our dictionary
                  and applied to seismic data.},

                  account for the sharpness of globally observed
                  upper-mantle seismic discontinuities. We propose a
                  percolation-based model for the elastic properties
                  of the phase mixture in the coexistence regions
                  associated with these transitions. The major
                  consequence of the model is that the elastic moduli
                  (but not the density) display a singularity at the
                  percolation threshold of the high-pressure
                  phase. This model not only explains the sharp but
                  continuous change in seismic velocities across the
                  phase transition, but also predicts its abruptness
                  and scale invariance, which are characterized by a
                  non-integral scale exponent. Using the
                  receiver-function approach and new, powerful

  pages = {781-799},
  abstract = {Predictive multiple suppression methods consist of two
                  main steps: a prediction step, during which
                  multiples are predicted from seismic data, and a
                  primary-multiple separation step, during which the
                  predicted multiples are
                  {\textquoteright}matched{\textquoteright} with the
                  true multiples in the data and subsequently
                  removed. This second separation step, which we will
                  call the estimation step, is crucial in practice: an
                  incorrect separation will cause residual multiple
                  energy in the result or may lead to a distortion of
                  the primaries, or both. To reduce these adverse
                  effects, a new transformed-domain method is proposed
                  where primaries and multiples are separated rather
                  than matched. This separation is carried out on the
                  basis of differences in the multiscale and
                  multidirectional characteristics of these two signal
                  components. Our method uses the curvelet transform,
                  which maps multidimensional data volumes into almost
                  orthogonal localized multidimensional prototype
                  waveforms that vary in directional and
                  spatio-temporal content. Primaries-only and
                  multiples-only signal components are recovered from
                  the total data volume by a non-linear optimization
                  scheme that is stable under noisy input data. During
                  the optimization, the two signal components are
                  separated by enhancing sparseness (through weighted
                  l1-norms) in the transformed domain subject to
                  fitting the observed data as the sum of the
                  separated components to within a user-defined
                  tolerance level. Whenever, during the optimization,
                  the estimates for the primaries in the transformed
                  domain correlate with the predictions for the
                  multiples, the recovery of the coefficients for the
                  estimated primaries will be suppressed while for
                  regions where the correlation is small the method
                  seeks the sparsest set of coefficients that
                  represent the estimation for the primaries. Our
                  algorithm does not seek a matched filter and as such
                  it differs fundamentally from traditional adaptive
                  subtraction methods. The method derives its
                  stability from the sparseness obtained by a
                  non-parametric (i.e. not depending on a parametrized
                  physical model) multiscale and multidirectional
                  overcomplete signal representation. This sparsity
                  serves as prior information and allows for a
                  Bayesian interpretation of our method during which
                  the log-likelihood function is minimized while the
                  two signal components are assumed to be given by a
                  superposition of prototype waveforms, drawn
                  independently from a probability function that is
                  weighted by the predicted primaries and
                  multiples. In this paper, the predictions are based
                  on the data-driven surface-related multiple
                  elimination method. Synthetic and field data
                  examples show a clean separation leading to a
                  considerable improvement in multiple suppression
                  compared to the conventional method of adaptive
                  matched filtering. This improved separation
                  translates into an improved stack.},

                  for iterative techniques to attain accurate
                  migration amplitudes. These iterative methods are
                  important because they complement theoretical
                  approaches that are hampered by difficulties to
                  control problems such as finite-acquisition
                  aperture, source-receiver frequency response, and
                  directivity. To solve these problems, we apply
                  preconditioning, which significantly improves
                  convergence of least-squares migration. We discuss
                  different levels of preconditioning that range from
                  corrections for the order of the migration operator
                  to corrections for spherical spreading, and position
                  and reflector-dip dependent amplitude errors. While
                  the first two corrections correspond to simple

                  major impediment within seismic imaging. By turning

                  sampling the sources, followed by solving a reduced

  abstract = {Seismic data recovery from data with missing traces on
                  otherwise regular acquisition grids forms a crucial
                  step in the seismic processing flow. For instance,
                  unsuccessful recovery leads to imaging artifacts and
                  to erroneous predictions for the multiples,
                  adversely affecting the performance of multiple
                  elimination. A non-parametric transform-based
                  recovery method is presented that exploits the
                  compression of seismic data volumes by recently
                  developed curvelet frames. The elements of this
                  transform are multidimensional and directional and
                  locally resemble wavefronts present in the data,
                  which leads to a compressible representation for
                  seismic data. This compression enables us to
                  formulate a new curvelet-based seismic data recovery
                  algorithm through sparsity-promoting inversion. The
                  concept of sparsity-promoting inversion is in itself
                  not new to geophysics. However, the recent insights
                  from the field of {\textquoteleft}compressed
                  sensing{\textquoteright} are new since they clearly
                  identify the three main ingredients that go into a
                  successful formulation of a recovery problem, namely
                  a sparsifying transform, a sampling strategy that
                  subdues coherent aliases and a sparsity-promoting
                  program that recovers the largest entries of the
                  curvelet-domain vector while explaining the
                  measurements. These concepts are illustrated with a
                  stylized experiment that stresses the importance of
                  the degree of compression by the sparsifying
                  transform. With these findings, a curvelet-based
                  recovery algorithms is developed, which recovers
                  seismic wavefields from seismic data volumes with
                  large percentages of traces missing. During this
                  construction, we benefit from the main three
                  ingredients of compressive sampling, namely the
                  curvelet compression of seismic data, the existence
                  of a favorable sampling scheme and the formulation
                  of a large-scale sparsity-promoting solver based on
                  a cooling method. The recovery performs well on
                  synthetic as well as real data and performs better
                  by virtue of the sparsifying property of
                  curvelets. Our results are applicable to other areas
                  such as global seismology.},

  abstract = {Seismic imaging is a linearized inversion problem
                  relying on the minimization of a least-squares
                  misfit functional as a function of the medium
                  perturbation. The success of this procedure hinges
                  on our ability to handle large systems of
                  equations---whose size grows exponentially with the
                  demand for higher resolution images in more and more
                  complicated areas---and our ability to invert these
                  systems given a limited amount of computational
                  resources. To overcome this "curse of
                  dimensionality" in problem size and computational
                  complexity, we propose a combination of randomized
                  dimensionality-reduction and divide-and-conquer
                  techniques. This approach allows us to take
                  advantage of sophisticated sparsity-promoting
                  solvers that work on a series of smaller subproblems
                  each involving a small randomized subset of
                  data. These subsets correspond to artificial
                  simultaneous-source experiments made of random
                  superpositions of sequential-source experiments. By
                  changing these subsets after each subproblem is
                  solved, we are able to attain an inversion quality
                  that is competitive while requiring fewer
                  computational, and possibly, fewer acquisition
                  resources. Application of this concept to a
                  controlled series of experiments showed the validity
                  of our approach and the relationship between its
                  efficiency---by reducing the number of sources and
                  hence the number of wave-equation solves---and the
                  image quality. Application of our
                  dimensionality-reduction methodology with sparsity
                  promotion to a complicated synthetic with well-log
                  constrained structure also yields excellent results
                  underlining the importance of sparsity promotion.},

                  image recovery with sparseness and continuity
                  constraints is proposed. We observe that curvelets,
                  as a directional frame expansion, lead to sparsity
                  of seismic images and exhibit invariance under the
                  normal operator of the linearized imaging
                  problem. Based on this observation we derive a
                  method for stable recovery of the migration
                  amplitudes from noisy data. The method corrects the
                  amplitudes during a post-processing step after
                  migration, such that the main additional cost is one
                  ap- plication of the normal operator, i.e. a
                  modeling followed by a migration. Asymptotically
                  this normal operator corresponds to a
                  pseudodifferential operator, for which a convenient
                  diagonal approximation in the curvelet domain is
                  derived, including a bound for its error and a
                  method for the estimation of the diagonal from a
                  compound operator consisting of discrete
                  implementations for the scattering operator and its
                  adjoint the migration operator. The solution is
                  formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem where
                  sparsity in the curvelet domain as well as
                  continuity along the imaged reflectors are jointly
                  promoted. To enhance sparsity, the $ell_1$-norm on the
                  curvelet coefficients is minimized, while continuity
                  is promoted by minimizing an anisotropic diffusion
                  norm on the image. The performance of the recovery
                  scheme is evaluated with a time-reversed

                  quality of seismic imaging. Despite major advances
                  made by surface-related multiple elimination (SRME),
                  amplitude errors in the predicted multiples remain a
                  problem. When these errors vary for each type of
                  multiple in different ways (as a function of offset,
                  time, and dip), they pose a serious challenge for
                  conventional least-squares matching and for the
                  recently introduced separation by curvelet-domain
                  thresholding. We propose a data-adaptive method that
                  corrects amplitude errors, which vary smoothly as a
                  function of location, scale (frequency band), and
                  angle. With this method, the amplitudes can be

                  that, from a traditional point of view, are

                  this approach is a new technology where acquisition
                  and processing related costs are decoupled the
                  stringent Nyquist sampling criterion. At the heart
                  of our approach lies randomized incoherent sampling
                  that breaks subsampling-related interferences by
                  turning them into harmless noise, which we
                  subsequently remove by promoting sparsity in a
                  transform-domain. Acquisition schemes designed to
                  fit into this regime no longer grow significantly in
                  cost with increasing resolution and dimensionality
                  of the survey area, but instead its cost ideally
                  only depends on transform-domain sparsity of the
                  expected data. Our contribution is twofold. First,
                  we demonstrate by means of carefully designed
                  numerical experiments that ideas from compressive
                  sensing can be adapted to seismic
                  acquisition. Second, we leverage the property that
                  seismic data volumes are well approximated by a
                  small percentage of curvelet coefficients. Thus
                  curvelet-domain sparsity allows us to recover
                  conventionally-sampled seismic data volumes from
                  compressively-sampled data volumes whose size
                  exceeds this percentage by only a small
                  factor. Because compressive sensing combines
                  transformation and encoding by a single linear
                  encoding step, this technology is directly
                  applicable to seismic acquisition and therefore
                  constitutes a new paradigm where acquisitions costs
                  scale with transform-domain sparsity instead of the
                  gridsize. We illustrate this principle by showcasing
                  recovery of a real seismic line from simulated
                  compressively sampled acquisitions.},

  abstract = {Suppression of incoherent noise, which is present in the
                  seismic signal and may often lead to ambiguous
                  interpretation, is a key step in processing
                  associated with crustal reflection data. In this
                  paper, we make use of the parsimonious
                  representation of seismic data in the curvelet
                  domain to perform the noise attenuation while
                  preserving the coherent energy and its amplitude
                  information. Curvelets are a recently developed
                  mathematical transform that has as one of its
                  properties minimal overlap between seismic signal
                  and noise in the transform domain, thereby
                  facilitating signal-noise separation. The problem is
                  cast as an inverse problem and the results are
                  obtained by updating the solution at each
                  iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
                  procedure at removing noise on both synthetic shot
                  gathers and a synthetic stacked seismic section. We
                  then apply curvelet denoising to deep crustal
                  seismic reflection data where the signal-to-noise
                  ratio is low. The reflection data were recorded
                  along Lithoprobe's SNORCLE Line 1 across
                  Paleoproterozoic-Archean domains in Canada's
                  Northwest Territories. After initial processing, we
                  apply the iterative curvelet denoising to both
                  pre-stack shot gathers and post-stack data. Ground
                  roll, random noise and much of the anomalous
                  vertical energy is removed from the pre-stack shot
                  gathers, to the extent that crustal reflections,
                  including those from the Moho, are clearly seen on
                  individual gathers. Denoised stacked data show a
                  series of dipping reflections in the lower crust
                  that extend into the Moho. The Moho itself is
                  relatively flat and characterized by a sharp, narrow
                  band of reflections. Comparing the results for the
                  stacked data with those from F-X deconvolution,
                  curvelet denoising outperforms the latter by
                  attenuating incoherent noise with minimal harm to
                  the signal. Because curvelet denoising retains
                  amplitude information, it provides opportunities for
                  further studies of seismic sections through
                  attribute analyses. Curvelet denoising provides an
                  important new tool in the processing toolbox for
                  crustal seismic reflection data.},

  abstract = {We explore the use of stochastic optimization methods
                  for seismic waveform inversion. The basic principle
                  of such methods is to randomly draw a batch of
                  realizations of a given misfit function and goes
                  back to the 1950s. The ultimate goal of such an
                  approach is to dramatically reduce the computational
                  cost involved in evaluating the misfit. Following
                  earlier work, we introduce the stochasticity in
                  waveform inversion problem in a rigorous way via a
                  technique called randomized trace estimation. We
                  then review theoretical results that underlie recent
                  developments in the use of stochastic methods for
                  waveform inversion. We present numerical experiments
                  to illustrate the behavior of different types of
                  stochastic optimization methods and investigate the
                  sensitivity to the batch size and the noise level in

                  results that are qualitatively similar to the
                  solution of the full problem with modest batch
                  sizes, even on noisy data. Each iteration of the
                  corresponding stochastic methods requires an order
                  of magnitude fewer PDE solves than a comparable
                  deterministic method applied to the full problem,
                  which may lead to an order of magnitude speedup for
                  waveform inversion in practice.},

  journal = {Geophysical Prospecting},
  year = {2013},
  month = {06},

  pages = {10-19},
  abstract = {Randomized source encoding has recently been proposed as
                  a way to dramatically reduce the costs of full
                  waveform inversion. The main idea is to replace all
                  sequential sources by a small number of simultaneous
                  sources. This introduces random crosstalk in the
                  model updates and special stochastic optimization
                  strategies are required to deal with this. Two
                  problems arise with this approach: i) source
                  encoding can only be applied to fixed-spread
                  acquisition setups, and ii) stochastic optimization
                  methods tend to converge very slowly, relying on
                  averaging to get rid of the cross-talk. Although the
                  slow convergence is partly offset by the low
                  iteration cost, we show that conventional
                  optimization strategies are bound to outperform
                  stochastic methods in the long run. In this paper we
                  argue that we don¬øt need randomized source encoding
                  to reap the benefits of stochastic optimization and
                  we review an optimization strategy that combines the
                  benefits of both conventional and stochastic
                  optimization. The method uses a gradually increasing
                  batch of sources. Thus, iterations are very cheap
                  initially and this allows the method to make fast
                  progress in the beginning. As the batch size grows,
                  the method behaves like conventional optimization,
                  allowing for fast convergence. Numerical examples
                  suggest that the stochastic and hybrid method
                  perform equally well with and without source
                  encoding and that the hybrid method outperforms both
                  conventional and stochastic optimization. The method
                  does not rely on source encoding techniques and can
                  thus be applied to non fixed-spread data.},

  abstract = {Wave-equation based seismic inversion can be formulated
                  as a nonlinear inverse problem where the medium
                  properties are obtained via minimization of a least-
                  squares misfit functional. The demand for higher
                  resolution models in more geologically complex areas
                  drives the need to develop techniques that explore
                  the special structure of full-waveform inversion to
                  reduce the computational burden and to regularize
                  the inverse problem. We meet these goals by using
                  ideas from compressive sensing and stochastic
                  optimization to design a novel Gauss-Newton method,
                  where the updates are computed from random subsets
                  of the data via curvelet-domain sparsity
                  promotion. Application of this idea to a realistic
                  synthetic shows improved results compared to
                  quasi-Newton methods, which require passes through
                  all data. Two different subset sampling strategies
                  are considered: randomized source encoding, and
                  drawing sequential shots firing at random source
                  locations from marine data with missing near and far
                  offsets. In both cases, we obtain excellent

  abstract = {An explicit algorithm for the extrapolation of one-way
                  wavefields is proposed that combines recent
                  developments in information theory and theoretical
                  signal processing with the physics of wave
                  propagation. Because of excessive memory
                  requirements, explicit formulations for wave
                  propagation have proven to be a challenge in 3D. By
                  using ideas from compressed sensing, we are able to
                  formulate the (inverse) wavefield extrapolation
                  problem on small subsets of the data volume, thereby
                  reducing the size of the operators. Compressed
                  sensing entails a new paradigm for signal recovery
                  that provides conditions under which signals can be
                  recovered from incomplete samplings by nonlinear
                  recovery methods that promote sparsity of the
                  to-be-recovered signal. According to this theory,
                  signals can be successfully recovered when the
                  measurement basis is incoherent with the
                  representa-tion in which the wavefield is sparse. In
                  this new approach, the eigenfunctions of the
                  Helmholtz operator are recognized as a basis that is
                  incoherent with curvelets that are known to compress
                  seismic wavefields. By casting the wavefield
                  extrapolation problem in this framework, wavefields
                  can be successfully extrapolated in the modal
                  domain, despite evanescent wave modes.  The degree
                  to which the wavefield can be recovered depends on
                  the number of missing (evanescent) wavemodes and on
                  the complexity of the wavefield. A proof of
                  principle for the compressed sensing method is given
                  for inverse wavefield extrapolation in 2D, together
                  with a pathway to 3D during which the multiscale and
                  multiangular properties of curvelets, in relation to
                  the Helmholz operator, are exploited. The results
                  show that our method is stable, has reduced dip
                  limitations, and handles evanescent waves in inverse

                  costly process that calls for the adoption of
                  simultaneous-source or randomized acquisition - an
                  emerging technology that is stimulating both
                  geophysical research and commercial
                  efforts. Simultaneous marine acquisition calls for
                  the development of a new set of design principles
                  and post-processing tools. In this paper, we discuss
                  the properties of a specific class of randomized
                  simultaneous acquisition matrices and demonstrate
                  that sparsity-promoting recovery improves the
                  quality of reconstructed seismic data volumes. We
                  propose a practical randomized marine acquisition
                  scheme where the sequential sources fire airguns at
                  only randomly time-dithered instances. We
                  demonstrate that the recovery using sparse
                  approximation from random time-dithering with a
                  single source approaches the recovery from
                  simultaneous-source acquisition with multiple
                  sources. Established findings from the field of
                  compressive sensing indicate that the choice of the
                  sparsifying transform that is incoherent with the
                  compressive sampling matrix can significantly impact
                  the reconstruction quality. Leveraging these
                  findings, we then demonstrate that the compressive
                  sampling matrix resulting from our proposed sampling
                  scheme is incoherent with the curvelet
                  transform. The combined measurement matrix exhibits
                  better isometry properties than other transform
                  bases such as a non-localized multidimensional
                  Fourier transform. We illustrate our results with
                  simulations of "ideal" simultaneous-source marine
                  acquisition, which dithers both in time and space,

                  $\Delta_p$, a class of compressed sensing decoders
                  that rely on $l^p$ minimization with $p \in (0,1)$
                  to recover estimates of sparse and compressible
                  signals from incomplete and inaccurate
                  measurements. In particular, we extend the results
                  of Cand{\textquoteleft}es, Romberg and Tao [3] and
                  Wojtaszczyk [30] regarding the decoder $\Delta_1$,
                  based on $\ell^1$ minimization, to $\Delta p$ with
                  $p \in (0,1)$. Our results are two-fold. First, we
                  show that under certain sufficient conditions that
                  are weaker than the analogous sufficient conditions
                  for $\Delta_1$ the decoders $\Delta_p$ are robust to
                  noise and stable in the sense that they are $(2,p)$
                  instance optimal. Second, we extend the results of
                  Wojtaszczyk to show that, like $\Delta_1$, the
                  decoders $\Delta_p$ are (2,2) instance optimal in
                  probability provided the measurement matrix is drawn
                  from an appropriate distribution. While the
                  extension of the results of [3] to the setting where
                  $p \in (0,1)$ is straightforward, the extension of
                  the instance optimality in probability result of
                  [30] is non-trivial. In particular, we need to prove
                  that the $LQ_1$ property, introduced in [30], and
                  shown to hold for Gaussian matrices and matrices
                  whose columns are drawn uniformly from the sphere,
                  generalizes to an $LQ_p$ property for the same
                  classes of matrices. Our proof is based on a result
                  by Gordon and Kalton [18] about the Banach-Mazur

  abstract = {Successful removal of coherent noise sources greatly
                  determines the quality of seismic imaging. Major
                  advances were made in this direction, e.g.,
                  Surface-Related Multiple Elimination (SRME) and
                  interferometric ground-roll removal. Still, moderate
                  phase, timing, amplitude errors and clutter in the
                  predicted signal components can be detrimental.
                  Adopting a Bayesian approach along with the
                  assumption of approximate curvelet-domain
                  independence of the to-be-separated signal
                  components, we construct an iterative algorithm that
                  takes the predictions produced by for example SRME
                  as input and separates these components in a robust
                  fashion. In addition, the proposed algorithm
                  controls the energy mismatch between the separated
                  and predicted components. Such a control, which was
                  lacking in earlier curvelet-domain formulations,
                  produces improved results for primary-multiple
                  separation on both synthetic and real data.},
