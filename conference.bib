  abstract = {Neural density estimators, such as invertible normalizing flows, are capable of estimating the Bayesian posterior distribution in a variety of imaging problems, including medical MRI and seismic imaging/monitoring. So far, few works explore the possibility to make explicit use of probabilistic information contained within the full Bayesian solution of these inverse problems. During our talk, we investigate how a simple modification to the training objective of conditional normalizing flows allows for Bayesian experimental design without modifying the normalizing flow's neural architecture itself. By establishing a key relationship between the expected information gain (EIG) and the maximum-likelihood, attained during the training of normalizing flows, we show that optimal experimental design can be achieved. During our talk, we first verify, on a stylized problem, that our method indeed maximizes the expected information gain, followed by demonstrating the advocacy of our methodology on large-scale medical and seismic problems.},

  abstract = {Diffusion generative models are powerful frameworks for learning high-dimensional distributions and synthesizing high-fidelity images. However, their efficacy in training predominantly hinges on the availability of complete, high-quality training datasets, a condition that often proves unattainable, particularly in the domain of subsurface velocity-model generation. In this work, we propose to synthesize proxy subsurface velocities from incomplete well and imaged seismic observations by introducing additional corruptions to the observations during the training phase. In this context, proxy velocity models refer to random realizations of subsurface velocities that are close in distribution to the actual subsurface velocities. These proxy models can be used as priors to train neural networks with simulation-based inference. Our approach facilitates the generation of these proxy velocity samples by utilizing available datasets composed merely of seismic images and 5 (for now) wells per seismic image.After training, our foundation generative model permits the generation of velocity samples derived from unseen RTMs without the need of having access to wells.},

  abstract = {Common-image gathers (CIGs) are pivotal in migration-velocity analysis (MVA). However, MVA is often hindered by the computational burden of traditional migration methods. To bypass these limitations, we introduce a neural-surrogate learning approach that utilizes Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs, Li et al. 2020) to accelerate MVA. Following the velocity-continuation scheme of Siahkoohi, Louboutin, and Herrmann (2022), we train a survey-specific FNO to map the CIGs associated with one migration-velocity model to another without remigration. This methodology leverages the capacity of FNOs to approximate complex PDE-based mappings, rendering computational cost at inference negligible, thereby expediting MVA. By enabling rapid generation and evaluation of CIGs across various velocity models, it offers a pathway to quickly examine velocity models according to preferred properties and to quantify uncertainties in imaged reflectivities at the same time. Additionally, this methodology paves the way for inverse design optimization, updating velocity models to produce CIGs with desirable characteristics.},

These methods enable the effective monitoring and control of CO2 storage projects, addressing challenges such as subsurface complexity, operational optimization, and risk mitigation. By integrating diverse monitoring data, e.g., geophysical well observations and imaged seismic, DT can bridge the gaps between seemingly distinct fields like geophysics and reservoir engineering. In addition, the recent advancements in genAI also facilitate DT with principled uncertainty quantification. Through recursive training and inference, DT utilizes simulated current state samples, e.g., CO2 saturation, paired with corresponding geophysical field observations to train its neural networks and enable posterior sampling upon receiving new field data. However, it lacks decision-making and control capabilities, which is necessary for full DT functionality. This study aims to demonstrate how DT can inform decision-making processes to prevent risks such as cap rock fracturing during CO2 storage operations.},

wells for direct CO2 and pressure monitoring at specific locations. Given the high
costs associated with drilling, it is crucial to strategically place a limited number of

approach for selecting well locations integrates fluid-flow solvers for forecasting
plume trajectories with generative neural networks for plume inference uncertainty.
Our methodology is extensible to three-dimensional domains and is developed
within a Bayesian framework for optimal experimental design, ensuring scalability
and mathematical optimality. We use a realistic case study to verify these claims

  abstract = {As the global deployment of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology intensifies in the fight against climate change, it becomes increasingly imperative to establish robust monitoring and detection mechanisms for potential underground CO${_2}$ leakage, particularly through pre-existing or induced faults in the storage reservoir's seals. While techniques such as history matching and time-lapse seismic monitoring of CO${_2}$ storage have been used successfully in tracking the evolution of CO${_2}$ plumes in the subsurface, these methods lack principled approaches to characterize uncertainties related to the CO$_2$ plumes' behavior. Inclusion of systematic assessment of uncertainties is essential for risk mitigation for the following reasons: (i) CO$_2$ plume-induced changes are small and seismic data is noisy; (ii) changes between regular and irregular (e.g., caused by leakage) flow patterns are small; and (iii) the reservoir properties that control the flow are strongly heterogeneous and typically only available as distributions. To arrive at a formulation capable of inferring flow patterns for regular and irregular flow from well and seismic data, the performance of conditional normalizing flow will be analyzed on a series of carefully designed numerical experiments. While the inferences presented are preliminary in the context of an early CO$_2$ leakage detection system, the results do indicate that inferences with conditional normalizing flows can produce high-fidelity estimates for CO$_2$ plumes with or without leakage. We are also confident that the inferred uncertainty is reasonable because it correlates well with the observed errors. This uncertainty stems from noise in the seismic data and from the lack of precise knowledge of the reservoir's fluid flow properties.}

approximations of posterior distributions in the context of Bayesian inverse
problems, which is inspired by loop-unrolled gradient descent methods and is
theoretically grounded in maximally informative summary statistics. Amortized
variational inference is restricted by the expressive power of the chosen
variational distribution and the availability of training data in the form of
joint data and parameter samples, which often lead to approximation errors
such as the amortization gap. To address this issue, we propose an iterative
framework that refines the current amortized posterior approximation at each
step. Our approach involves alternating between two steps: (1) constructing a
training dataset consisting of pairs of summarized data residuals and
parameters, where the summarized data residual is generated using a
gradient-based summary statistic, and (2) training a conditional generative
model -- a normalizing flow in our examples -- on this dataset to obtain a
probabilistic update of the unknown parameter. This procedure leads to
iterative refinement of the amortized posterior approximations without the
need for extra training data. We validate our method in a controlled setting
by applying it to a stylized problem, and observe improved posterior
approximations with each iteration. Additionally, we showcase the capability
of our method in tackling realistically sized problems by applying it to
transcranial ultrasound, a high-dimensional, nonlinear inverse problem
governed by wave physics, and observe enhanced posterior quality through
better image reconstruction with the posterior mean.}

large incoming observations. This compression enables efficient training of the normalizing flow and standardizes the size of the data regardless of imaging configurations. The
combinations of these methods results in fast uncertainty-aware image reconstruction that
generalizes to a variety of transducer configurations. We evaluate our approach with in

comparing against the traditional physics-only method and also verify that our provided

While domain-specific solutions exist for each of these sub-disciplines, integrating these approaches – which may involve different programming languages – into a single coupled scalable inversion framework that supports algorithmic differentiation can be a challenge. However, we show that challenges like this can be met when working with proper abstractions. In our inversion example, this involves math-inspired symbolic abstractions for numerical solutions of the wave equation (Devito), matrix-free implementations for its Jacobians (JUDI.jl), abstractions for Automatic Differentiation (ChainRules.jl), and homegrown implementations for conditional Invertible Neural Networks (InvertibleNetworks.jl) and Fourier Neural Operators (ParametricOperators.jl).},

  abstract = {Machine learning algorithms such as Normalizing Flows, VAEs, and
GANs are powerful tools in Bayesian uncertainty quantification (UQ) of
inverse problems. Unfortunately, when using these algorithms medical imaging
practitioners are faced with the challenging task of manually defining neural
networks that can handle complicated inputs such as acoustic data. This task
needs to be replicated for different receiver types or configurations since
these change the dimensionality of the input. We propose to first transform
the data using the adjoint operator —ex: time reversal in photoacoustic
imaging (PAI) or back-projection in computer tomography (CT) imaging  —
then continue posterior inference using the adjoint data as an input now that
it has been standardized to the size of the unknown model. This adjoint
preprocessing technique has been used in previous works but with minimal
discussion on if it is biased. In this work, we prove that conditioning on
adjoint data is unbiased for a certain class of inverse problems. We then
demonstrate with two medical imaging examples  (PAI and CT) that adjoints
enable two things: Firstly, adjoints partially undo the physics of the
forward operator resulting in faster convergence of an ML based Bayesian UQ
technique. Secondly, the algorithm is now robust to changes in the observed
data caused by differing transducer subsampling in PAI and number of angles
in CT.  Our adjoint-based Bayesian inference method results in point
estimates that are faster to compute than traditional baselines and show
higher SSIM metrics, while also providing validated UQ.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference for high-dimensional inverse problems is challenged by the computational costs associated with the forward operator during posterior sampling, as well as the selection of an appropriate prior distribution that encodes our prior knowledge about the unknown. Amortized variational inference addresses these challenges by pretraining a conditional normalizing flow (cNF) that approximates the posterior distribution over the existing model and data joint samples where the prior is implicitly learned from the data. When fed data and normally distributed latent samples as input, the pretrained cNF provides posterior samples for previously unseen data virtually for free. The accuracy of this purely data-driven approach, however, is dependent on the availability of high-fidelity training data, which is rarely the case with geophysical inverse problems, due to the highly heterogeneous structure of the Earth. To overcome this challenge and to minimize the negative bias of data distribution shifts during inference, we propose learning a physics-based correction to the cNF latent distribution to provide a more accurate approximation to the posterior distribution. We accomplish this by parameterizing the cNF latent distribution by a Gaussian distribution with an unknown mean and diagonal covariance, which are estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the corrected posterior distribution estimate and the true posterior distribution. For a relatively well-trained cNF, this approach provides reliable posterior samples with a limited computational cost while remaining bound to data and physics. We showcase the computational gains of this approach on a "quasi" real seismic imaging example.},

supplementing the convolutional encoder of a neural speech codec with
Transformer speech embeddings yields a speech codec with a bitrate of 600 bps
that outperforms the original neural speech codec in synthesized speech
quality when trained at the same bitrate. Subjective human evaluations
suggest that the quality of the resulting codec is comparable or better than
that of conventional codecs operating at three to four times the rate.},

physics-guided data misfit and a Gaussian prior on the NF latent variable.
Solving this optimization problem with respect to the latent variable enables
us to leverage the benefits of data-driven conditional priors whilst being

limitations in its imaging resolution. Ultrasonics, on the other hand, can
theoretically provide resolution of medical diagnostic value, but produce
images of mechanical properties whose contrasts are not sensitive. In
photoacoustics, optical and acoustic effects are combined to gain the best of
both worlds. Under conditions of thermal and stress confinement, thermal
energy can efficiently build up in biological tissues, which in turn undergo
thermal expansion and effectively act as a spatially distributed acoustic
source. In photoacoustic imaging, the actual object of interest is the
induced source, as it is directly related to optical absorption and can be

  abstract = {In this work, we use a conditional normalizing flow (CNF) to address the seismic velocity inversion problem. Considering the large dimension difference between seismic data and velocity model, we reduce the data dimension by calculating its reverse time. After that, we train the CNF on pairs of migrated data and velocity. During inference, given a new seismic data, feeding the corresponding migrated image into the trained CNF will lead to posterior samples of the velocity inversion distribution. In addition, uncertainty quantification of the inverted results can be achieved by statistical metrics like mean and standard deviation. In our numerical example, the implementation is based on open-sourced software InvertibleNetworks.jl (Witte et al., 2021), JUDI.jl (Witte et al., 2019) and Devito (Louboutin et al., 2019). The training dataset are built based on the SEG/EAGE Overthrust model. For an unseen seismic data, the posterior samples of inversion results given by the trained CNF can be considered as good estimates of the true velocity. Especially, judging from the metrics like MAE, MSE, PSNR, SSIM, et al., the posterior mean is usually closer to the true velocity and the standard deviation indicates that the velocity value is more reliable within the subsurface layers than that on layer edges. Moreover, the inverted results, either the posterior samples or posterior mean, can be used as an initial model in the subsequent FWI for a more accurate result.},

  abstract = {Stencil kernels dominate a range of scientific applications
including seismic and medical imaging, image processing, and neural networks.
Temporal blocking is a performance optimisation that aims to reduce the
required memory bandwidth of stencil computations by re-using data from the
cache for multiple time steps. It has already been shown to be beneficial for
this class of algorithms. However, optimising stencils for practical
applications remains challenging. These computations often include sparsely
located operators, not aligned with the computational grid ("off-the-grid").
For example, our work is motivated by sources that inject a wavefield and
measurements interpolating grid values. The resulting data dependencies make
the adoption of temporal blocking much more challenging. We propose a
methodology to inspect these data dependencies and reorder the computation,
leading to performance gains in stencil codes where temporal blocking has not
been applicable. We implement this novel scheme in the Devito domain-specific
compiler toolchain. Devito implements a domain-specific language embedded in
Python to generate optimised partial differential equation solvers using the
finite-difference method from high-level symbolic problem definitions. We
evaluate our scheme using isotropic acoustic, anisotropic acoustic and
isotropic elastic wave propagators of industrial significance. Performance
evaluation, after auto-tuning, shows that this enables substantial
performance improvement through temporal blocking, over highly-optimised
vectorized spatially-blocked code of up to 1.6x.},

description of the solution in ill-posed inverse problems. Sampling from the

high-dimensionality of the unknown and the expensive-to-evaluate forward
operator. These challenges limit the applicability of Markov Chain sampling
methods due to the costs associated with the forward operator. Moreover,
explicitly choosing a prior distribution that captures the true heterogeneity
exhibited by the Earth's subsurface further complicates casting seismic
imaging into a Bayesian framework. To handle this situation and to assess
uncertainty, we propose a data-driven variational inference approach based on
conditional normalizing flows (NFs). The proposed scheme leverages existing
data, which are in the form of low- and high-fidelity migrated image pairs,
to train a conditional NF capable of characterizing the posterior
distribution. After training, the NF can be used to sample from the posterior
distribution associated with a previously unseen seismic survey, which is in
some sense close, e.g., data from a neighboring survey area. In our numerical
example, we obtain high-fidelity images from the Parihaka dataset and
low-fidelity images are derived from these images through the process of
demigration, followed by adding band-limited noise and migration. During
inference, given shot records from a new neighboring seismic survey, we first
compute the reverse-time migration image. Next, by feeding this low-fidelity
migrated image to the NF we gain access to samples from the posterior

  abstract = {Time-lapse seismic monitoring of carbon storage and sequestration is often challenging because the time-lapse signature of the growth of {CO$_2$} plumes is weak in amplitude and therefore difficult to detect seismically. This situation is compounded by the fact that the surveys are often coarsely sampled and not replicated to reduce costs. As a result, images obtained for different vintages (baseline and monitor surveys) often contain artifacts that may be attributed wrongly to time-lapse changes. To address these issues, we propose to invert the baseline and monitor surveys jointly. By using the joint recovery model, we exploit information shared between multiple time-lapse surveys. Contrary to other time-lapse methods, our approach does not rely on replicating the surveys to detect time-lapse changes. To illustrate this advantage, we present a numerical sensitivity study where {CO$_2$} is injected in a realistic synthetic model. This model is representative of the geology in the southeast of the North Sea, an area currently considered for carbon sequestration. Our example demonstrates that the joint recovery model improves the quality of time-lapse images allowing us to monitor the {CO$_2$} plume seismically.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification for full-waveform inversion provides a
probabilistic characterization of the ill-conditioning of the problem,
comprising the sensitivity of the solution with respect to the starting model
and data noise. This analysis allows to assess the confidence in the
candidate solution and how it is reflected in the tasks that are typically
performed after imaging (e.g., stratigraphic segmentation following reservoir
characterization). Classically, uncertainty comes in the form of a
probability distribution formulated from Bayesian principles, from which we
seek to obtain samples. A popular solution involves Monte Carlo sampling.
Here, we propose instead an approach characterized by training a deep network
that "pushes forward" Gaussian random inputs into the model space
(representing, for example, density or velocity) as if they were sampled from
the actual posterior distribution. Such network is designed to solve a
variational optimization problem based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the posterior and the network output distributions. This work is
fundamentally rooted in recent developments for invertible networks. Special
invertible architectures, besides being computational advantageous with
respect to traditional networks, do also enable analytic computation of the
output density function. Therefore, after training, these networks can be

  abstract = {Incorporating prior knowledge on model unknowns of interest is
essential when dealing with ill-posed inverse problems due to the
nonuniqueness of the solution and data noise. Unfortunately, it is not
trivial to fully describe our priors in a convenient and analytical way.
Parameterizing the unknowns with a convolutional neural network (CNN), and
assuming an uninformative Gaussian prior on its weights, leads to a
variational prior on the output space that favors "natural" images and
excludes noisy artifacts, as long as overfitting is prevented. This is the
so-called deep-prior approach. In seismic imaging, however, evaluating the
forward operator is computationally expensive, and training a randomly
initialized CNN becomes infeasible. We propose, instead, a weak version of
deep priors, which consists of relaxing the requirement that reflectivity
models must lie in the network range, and letting the unknowns deviate from
the network output according to a Gaussian distribution. Finally, we jointly
solve for the reflectivity model and CNN weights. The chief advantage of this
approach is that the updates for the CNN weights do not involve the modeling
operator, and become relatively cheap. Our synthetic numerical experiments
demonstrate that the weak deep prior is more robust with respect to noise
than conventional least-squares imaging approaches, with roughly twice the
computational cost of reverse-time migration, which is the affordable
computational budget in large-scale imaging problems.},

  pages = {1636-1640},
  abstract = {In inverse problems, uncertainty quantification (UQ) deals with a
probabilistic description of the solution nonuniqueness and data noise
sensitivity. Setting seismic imaging into a Bayesian framework allows for a
principled way of studying uncertainty by solving for the model posterior
distribution. Imaging, however, typically constitutes only the first stage of
a sequential workflow, and UQ becomes even more relevant when applied to
subsequent tasks that are highly sensitive to the inversion outcome. In this
paper, we focus on how UQ trickles down to horizon tracking for the
determination of stratigraphic models and investigate its sensitivity with
respect to the imaging result. As such, the main contribution of this work
consists in a data-guided approach to horizon tracking uncertainty analysis.
This work is fundamentally based on a special reparameterization of
reflectivity, known as "deep prior". Feasible models are restricted to the
output of a convolutional neural network with a fixed input, while weights
and biases are Gaussian random variables. Given a deep prior model, the
network parameters are sampled from the posterior distribution via a Markov
chain Monte Carlo method, from which the conditional mean and point-wise
standard deviation of the inferred reflectivities are approximated. For each
sample of the posterior distribution, a reflectivity is generated, and the
horizons are tracked automatically. In this way, uncertainty on model
parameters naturally translates to horizon tracking. As part of the
validation for the proposed approach, we verified that the estimated
confidence intervals for the horizon tracking coincide with geologically
complex regions, such as faults.},

and the use of modern randomized (simultaneous-source) marine acquisition

(CNNs) to bring the receiver sampling to the same spatial grid as the dense
source sampling. To accomplish this task, we form training pairs consisting
of densely sampled data and artificially subsampled data using a reciprocity
argument and the assumption that the source-site sampling is dense. While
this approach has successfully been used on the recovery monochromatic
frequency slices, its application in practice calls for wavefield
reconstruction of time-domain data. Despite having the option to parallelize,
the overall costs of this approach can become prohibitive if we decide to
carry out the training and recovery independently for each frequency. Because
different frequency slices share information, we propose the use the method
of transfer training to make our approach computationally more efficient by
warm starting the training with CNN weights obtained from a neighboring
frequency slices. If the two neighboring frequency slices share information,
we would expect the training to improve and converge faster. Our aim is to
prove this principle by carrying a series of carefully selected experiments
on a relatively large-scale five-dimensional data synthetic data volume
associated with wide-azimuth 3D ocean bottom node acquisition. From these
experiments, we observe that by transfer training we are able t significantly
speedup in the training, specially at relatively higher frequencies where

rely on dense full-azimuth sampling. Unfortunately, the costs of acquiring
densely sampled data rapidly become prohibitive and we need to look for ways
to sparsely collect data, e.g. from sparsely distributed ocean bottom nodes,
from which we then derive densely sampled surveys through the method of
wavefield reconstruction. Because of their relatively cheap and simple
calculations, wavefield reconstruction via matrix factorizations has proven
to be a viable and scalable alternative to the more generally used
transform-based methods. While this method is capable of processing all full
azimuth data frequency by frequency slice, its performance degrades at higher
frequencies because monochromatic data at these frequencies is not as well
approximated by low-rank factorizations. We address this problem by proposing
a recursive recovery technique, which involves weighted matrix factorizations
where recovered wavefields at the lower frequencies serve as prior
information for the recovery of the higher frequencies. To limit the adverse
effects of potential overfitting, we propose a limited-subspace recursively
weighted matrix factorization approach where the size of the row and column
subspaces to construct the weight matrices is constrained. We apply our
method to data collected from the Gulf of Suez, and our results show that our
limited-subspace weighted recovery method significantly improves the recovery

  abstract = {Full subsurface extended image volumes (EIVs) contain abundant information such as subsurface image gathers used in imaging, interpretation of rock properties or velocity analysis, but are expensive in term of computational cost and storage requirement due to their large size. Yet, due to their redundant information, monochromatic EIVs exhibit a low-rank structure that allows us to get a good approximation at a computational cost proportional to the rank k , while conventional techniques require at least the number of sources. Such low-rank factorized EIVs are computed thanks to the randomized singular values decomposition (SVD) algorithm. However, recent developments on low-rank approximations of EIVs raise two major questions. First, monochromatic EIVs rely on time-harmonic wave equation solvers, which do not scale well to realistic 3D models. Second, the rank of the monochromatic EIVs increases with the frequency, which yields increasing computational costs and storage. Here, we propose a construction approach based on a time-domain finite-difference wave-equation solver with time stepping, which is combined to power iteration schemes in the randomized SVD algorithm to accelerate the decay of the singular values. We compare the performances of simultaneous iterations, block-Krylov iterations and the original randomized SVD on the computation of the EIV for a small section of the Marmousi model. Then, we show further results on the full Marmousi model to validate our approach.},

Rank minimization is an effective way to recovering the missing trace data. Unfortunately, this technique's performance may deteriorate at higher frequency because high-frequency data can not necessarily be captured accurately by low-rank matrix factorizations albeit remedies exist such as hierarchical semi-separable matrices. As a result, recovered data often suffers from low signal to noise ratio S/Rs at the higher frequencies. To deal with this situation, we propose a weighted recovery method that improves the performance at the high frequencies by recursively using information from matrix factorizations at neighboring lower frequencies. Essentially, we include prior information from previously reconstructed frequency slices during the wavefield reconstruction. We apply our method to data collected from the Gulf of Suez, which shows that our method performs well compared to the traditional method without weighting.},

A full-space optimization would require the storage of field variables for every frequency or time sample (and every source). Remedies via variable projection are well studied, but they entail the solution of a modified wave equation, which is costly both in frequency and time domain. Here, we explore an efficient alternative to WRI, where properties are complemented, instead, by elements of the dual data space. The starting point of our proposal is the denoising reformulation of WRI: the PDE compliance is optimized under the constraint of a given data fit. Since the field variable can be eliminated from the associated saddle-point problem, we obtain a new objective functional of only properties and Lagrange multipliers. Its evaluation, and gradient computation, involves the solution of the original wave equation, which is amenable to time-domain discretization. The optimization scheme of choice can now leverage on affordable storage of the iterates.},

However, in the time-domain, the computational cost and memory requirements of this approach scale with the size and recording length of the seismic experiment, thus making this approach often prohibitively expensive in practice. To overcome these issues, we borrow ideas from compressive sensing and signal processing and introduce an algorithm for sparsity-promoting seismic imaging using on-the-fly Fourier transforms. By computing gradients and functions values for random subsets of source locations and frequencies, we considerably limit the number of wave equation solves, while on-the-fly Fourier transforms allow computing an arbitrary number of monochromatic frequency-domain wavefields with a time-domain modeling code and without having to solve large-scale Helmholtz equations. The memory requirements of this approach are independent of the number of time steps and solely depend on the number of frequencies, which determine the amount of crosstalk and subsampling artifacts in the image. We show the application of our approach to several large-scale open source data sets and compare the results to a conventional time-domain approach with optimal checkpointing.},

This formulation builds on the success of additive image descriptions that are usually based on penalty methods, such as cartoon-texture decomposition and robust principal component analysis.

Moreover, having inaccurate overburden models, i.e water velocity model in the ocean bottom acquisition setting, may lead to erroneous velocity models. In order to obtain better velocity models, we simplify the FWI problem by decomposing the total two-way observed and predicted wavefields into one-way wavefields at the receiver locations using acoustic wavefield decomposition. We then propose to fit the less-complex one-way wavefield to obtain a velocity model that contains valuable information about the overburden. We use this inverted velocity model as a better initial model for the inversion using the other more-complex one-way wavefield. We demonstrate our proposed algorithm on acoustic non-inverse crime synthetic data produced from the Marmousi2 model. The proposed method provides improved inversion results compared with conventional FWI due to properly accounting for separate model updates from the up- and down-going wavefields.},

Back in the 80’s and early 90’s, the oil & gas industry was among the main drivers of HPC technology with a resurgence about ten years ago with the advent of full-waveform inversion-i.e., an adjoint-state method for inverse problems that involve the wave equation. 
While the combination of hardware developments and tedious manual coding efforts have resulted in major improvements, the rate of innovations is slow in part because of the inherent complexities of the mostly monolithic code bases. As a result, innovations make it too slowly into these optimized codes. This stifles innovation and could prevent adaptation of important developments such as machine learning with deep convolutional neural networks into existing workflows.
In comparison, the technological advances in the academic as well as commercial machine learning communities have been much faster in part because of robust and well abstracted code bases such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Since both machine learning and adjoint-state methods rely on back propagation strong similarities exist ready to be exploited.
During my talk, I will discuss lessons we learned in finding the appropriate abstractions, read Domain Specific Language, for time-stepping stencil-based finite differences in Devito, and how this is relevant for machine learning with deep networks. I will also share a vision on how ideas from machine learning can be merged into the development of the next-generation of wave-equation based imaging codes.
In particular, I will demonstrate the remarkable ability of deep convolutional networks to map low-fidelity dispersed numerical wave simulations to high-fidelity ones. I feel that this apparently generalizable capability of neural nets opens a complete new approach to tackle fundamental problems in computational exploration seismology.},

TV regularization fails to enforce this prior information into FWI. We propose a Mumford-Shah functional to incorporate the piecewise smooth spatial structure in the FWI procedure.

The main complexity arising from transverse tilted isotropic imaging is to model the receiver wavefield (back propagation of the data or data residual) for the imaging condition. Unlike the isotropic or the full physics wave-equations, the transverse tilted isotropic wave-equation is not not self-adjoint. This difference means that time-reversal will not model the correct receiver wavefield and this can lead to incorrect subsurface images.

Here we propose a sparsity-promoting image reconstruction method that
allows the estimation of each photoabsorber's source-time function.
Preliminary studies showed the ability to reconstruct the optical
absorption map of an in silico vessel phantom. By using a
sparsity-promoting imaging method, absorption maps and source-time
functions can still be recovered even in situations where the number of
transducers is decreased by a factor of six. Moreover, the recovery is
able to attain higher resolution than conventional beamforming methods.
Because our method recovers the source-time function of the
absorbers, it could potentially also be used to distinguish different
types of photoabsorbers, or the degree of aggregation of exogenous
agents, under the assumption that these would generate different
source-time functions at the moment of laser irradiation.},

appropriate static corrections on the data such that it becomes low rank in a

corrected for elevation statics. Due to the near-surface irregularities and
due to approximations used by static correction methods that lead to not fully
correcting for statics, an iterative residual statics correction becomes
necessary. Our proposed method corrects for residual statics without the
necessity of the surface consistency assumption and a multi-iterate process.
Additional benefits of the method include artifacts and noise suppression. We

including (i) substantial network waiting time due to repeated communications of
function and gradient values in the distributed environment, and (ii)
requirement of the sophisticated optimizer to solve an optimization problem
involving non-smooth regularizers. To circumvent these issues, we propose a
decentralized full-waveform inversion, a scheme where connected agents in a
network optimize their objectives locally while being in consensus. The
proposed formulation can be solved using the ADMM method efficiently. We demonstrate
using the standard marmousi model that such scheme can decouple the
regularization from data fitting and reduce the network waiting time.},

productivity of land acquisition in situations where deployment of many
vibrators and larger receiver spread is not possible in the field due to
obstructions or permit limitations. However, the existing framework requires
shooting the full sequence of encoded sweeps on each shot point to
reconstruct the complete frequency bandwidth Green's function. Although this simultaneous
shooting method reduces the sweeping time vs conventional sequential
shooting, the gain in efficiency is limited. To further reduce the sweeping time, we
propose to acquire randomly selected subsets of the encoded sweeps sequences

interpolation framework to reconstruct the full bandwidth deblended Green's
function. We demonstrate the advantages of proposed sampling and

  abstract = {A main challenge in seismic imaging is acquiring densely sampled data. Compressed Sensing has provided theoretical foundations upon which desired sampling rate can be achieved by applying a sparsity promoting algorithm on sub-sampled data. The key point in successful recovery is to deploy a randomized sampling scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for fast and accurate reconstruction of heavily under-sampled seismic data, regardless of type of sampling. A neural network learns to do reconstruction directly from data via an adversarial process. Once trained, the reconstruction can be done by just feeding the frequency slice with missing data into the neural network. This adaptive nonlinear model makes the algorithm extremely flexible, applicable to data with arbitrarily type of sampling. With the assumption that we have access to training data, the quality of reconstructed slice is superior even for extremely low sampling rate (as low as 10%) due to the data-driven nature of the method.},

  abstract = {Spatial Nyquist sampling rate, which is proportional to
                  the apparent subsurface velocity, is the key
                  deciding cost factor for conventional seismic
                  acquisition. Due to the lower shear wave velocity
                  compared with compressional waves, finer spatial
                  sampling is required to properly record the earlier,
                  which increases the acquisition costs. This is one
                  of the reasons why shear waves are usually not
                  considered in practice. To avoid having the Nyquist
                  criterion as the deciding cost factor and to utilize
                  multicomponent data to its available full extent, we
                  propose acquiring randomly undersampled ocean bottom
                  seismic data. Each component can then be
                  interpolated separately, followed by elastic
                  decomposition to recover up- and down-going
                  S-waves. Instead, we jointly interpolate and
                  decompose the recorded multicomponent data by
                  solving one sparsity promoting optimization
                  problem. This way we ensure that the relative
                  amplitudes of the multicomponent data is
                  preserved. We compare two sparsifying transforms:
                  the curvelet transform and the frequency-wavenumber
                  transform. Another key cost deciding factor for
                  seismic acquisition is the efficiency of acquiring
                  data. This calls for simultaneous acquisition, which
                  requires a source separation step. Similarly,
                  instead of taking a two-step approach, we perform a
                  sparsity-promoting joint source separation
                  decomposition. Results on economically and
                  efficiently acquired synthetic data of both joint
                  methods show their ability of reconstructing
                  accurate up- and down-going S-waves.},

                  of least-squares reverse-time migration (LS-RTM) of
                  primaries. In Marine data however, these
                  applications rely on the success of a pre-imaging
                  separation of primaries and multiples, which can be
                  modeled as a multi-dimensional convolution between
                  the vertical derivative of the surface-free Green’s
                  function and the down-going receiver
                  wavefield. Instead of imaging the primaries and
                  multiples separately, we implement the LS-RTM of the
                  total down-going wavefield by combining areal source
                  injection and linearized Born modelling, where
                  strong surface related multiples are generated from
                  a strong density variation at the ocean bottom. The
                  advantage including surface related multiples in
                  LS-RTM is the extra illumination we obtain from

                  multi-dimensional convolutions part of conventional

                  resources, given the multidimensional nature of the

                  minimal effects on results in the subsequent
                  processing procedures. We demonstrate the effective

                  fields in the true medium. The objective function is
                  often very oscillatory, which gives rise to
                  problematic local minima, and merely evaluating one
                  or more of its derivatives requires solving multiple
                  PDEs, which are expensive. In many applications such
                  as seismic exploration, only the source location is
                  available and the source signature itself is
                  unknown, which results in erroneous estimated
                  parameters. In this work, we propose a penalty
                  method to solve the PDE-constrained optimization
                  problem, whereby we replace the PDE constraints by a
                  two-norm penalty term, which leads to a bi-linear
                  optimization problem with a much less oscillatory
                  objective function. By applying the variable
                  projection method, we develop an efficient method to
                  invert the unknown parameters and source signatures
                  simultaneously. To reduce the computational cost, we
                  randomly select a subset of all data to update the
                  parameters at each iteration. Numerical examples
                  demonstrate that this method is less prone to
                  becoming stuck in harmful local minima and is able
                  to successfully invert the unknown parameters and
                  source signature with less computational cost
                  compared to using all the data.},

                  subsequent processing (e.g. EPSI) and

                  is a challenging process because cross-flow noise
                  dominates steep angles and low-frequency components

                  address some of the challenges of replicating
                  time-lapse surveys. These ideas, which stem from
                  distributed compressed sensing (DCS) led to the
                  birth of a joint recovery model (JRM) for processing
                  time-lapse data (noise-free) acquired from
                  non-replicated acquisition geometries. However, when

                  cross-correlation imaging condition suffers from
                  low-frequency artifacts that result from
                  backscattered energy in the background velocity
                  models. This problem translates to least-squares
                  reverse-time migration (LS-RTM), where these
                  artifacts slow down the convergence, as many of the
                  initial iterations are spent on removing them. In
                  RTM, this problem has been successfully addressed by
                  the introduction of the so-called inverse scattering
                  imaging condition, which naturally removes these
                  artifacts. In this work, we derive the corresponding
                  linearized forward operator of the inverse
                  scattering imaging operator and incorporate this
                  forward/adjoint operator pair into a
                  sparsity-promoting (SPLS-RTM) workflow. We
                  demonstrate on a challenging salt model, that LS-RTM

                  of PDE solves to a number comparable to conventional

  abstract = {The data of full-waveform inversion often contains
                  noise, which induces uncertainties in the inversion
                  results. Ideally, one would like to run a number of
                  independent inversions with different realizations
                  of the noise and assess model-side uncertainties
                  from the resulting models, however this is not
                  feasible because we collect the data only once. To
                  circumvent this restriction, various sampling
                  schemes have been devised to generate an ensemble of
                  models that fit the data to within the noise
                  level. Such sampling schemes typically involve
                  running multiple inversions or evaluating the
                  Hessian of the cost function, both of which are
                  computationally expensive. In this work, we propose
                  a new method to quantify uncertainties based on a
                  novel formulation of the full-waveform inversion
                  problem – wavefield reconstruction inversion. Based
                  on this formulation, we formulate a semidefinite
                  approximation of the corresponding Hessian
                  matrix. By precomputing certain quantities, we are
                  able to apply this Hessian to given input vectors
                  without additional solutions of the underlying
                  partial differential equations. To generate a
                  sample, we solve an auxiliary stochastic
                  optimization problem involving this Hessian. The
                  result is a computationally feasible method that,
                  with little overhead, can generate as many samples
                  as required at small additional cost. We test our
                  method on the synthetic BG Compass model and compare
                  the results to a direct-sampling approach. The
                  results show the feasibility of applying our method
                  to computing statistical quantities such as the mean
                  and standard deviation in the context of wavefield
                  reconstruction inversion.},

                  challenging inverse problems out there. For this
                  reason, it is remarkable that so much progress has
                  been made over the years. While we can look back
                  with confidence at an increasing number of success
                  stories, the application of full-waveform
                  technologies to deeper targets and complex geologies
                  remains challenging making it an expensive
                  proposition. So far, efforts to overcome some of
                  these challenges have mainly been directed towards
                  extended formulations such as Symes's and Biondi's
                  subsurface offset/rau-parameters, Mike Warner/Lluis
                  Guasch's Wiener filters in their adaptive
                  full-waveform inversion, and van Leeuwen/Herrmann's
                  Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion, where the
                  wave-equation appears as a least-squares term in the
                  objective. While this recent work --- including
                  other approaches such as different data-misfit
                  objective functions --- has removed some of FWI
                  cycle-skip issues it does, with the exception
                  perhaps of box constraints, not incorporate
                  rudimentary information on the geology on the
                  unknown model. Following recent work by Ernie Esser,
                  we present a general framework how to incorporate
                  this type of information in the form of
                  constraints. Contrary to Tikhonov-like
                  regularization or gradient filtering, imposing
                  constraints has several key advantages, namely (i)
                  they can be expressed in simple human understandable
                  terms such as lower and upper limits for the
                  velocity without the necessity to introduce
                  additional parameters and assumptions on the
                  probability distribution of the model; (ii) they can
                  consist of several constraints, e.g. box and
                  smoothness constraints, as long as their
                  intersection in non-empty; and (iii) they can be
                  imposed in a separate inner loop, which does not
                  affect gradients and Hessians of full-waveform
                  inversion itself. By means of examples, we will
                  demonstrate the advocacy of constrained formulations
                  as they apply to full-waveform inversion. This is

                  well, the recovery process can be computationally
                  expensive due to transform-domain redundancy. In
                  this paper, we present a computationally tractable
                  rank-minimization algorithm to separate simultaneous
                  data volumes. The proposed algorithm is suitable for
                  large-scale seismic data, since it avoids
                  singular-value decompositions and uses a low-rank
                  based factorized formulation instead. Results are

                  common problem formulation is a nonlinear
                  least-squares problem where the gradient is computed
                  using the adjoint-state algorithm. This formulation
                  offers parallelism for the computation of gradients
                  for different sources and frequencies. The
                  adjoint-state algorithm itself is sequential however
                  and this is a limiting factor when a lot of compute
                  nodes are available and only a few wavefields need
                  to be computed. This situation occurs when
                  stochastic optimization strategies are used to
                  minimize the objective function. We present a
                  parallel reformulation of the sequential

                  and adjoint wavefields to be computed in

                  equivalent but the parallel version is twice as fast

                  proposed algorithm is that one wavefield needs to be
                  computed per source and one per receiver. These
                  fields can be used to apply the (inverse)
                  Gauss-Newton Hessian to a vector without recomputing
                  wavefields. A 2D example shows that good
                  full-waveform inversion results are obtained, even
                  when a small number of sources and receivers is

                  approach to the approximate dispersion relation of
                  Etgen and Brandsberg-Dahl, in which we approximate
                  the exact dispersion relation through a polynomial
                  expansion and determine its coefficients by solving
                  a linear least squares problem that minimizes the
                  phase velocity error over the entire range of phase
                  angles. The coefficients are also optimized over a
                  pre-defined range of Thomsen parameters, so that the
                  phase error is small for models with spatially
                  varying anisotropy. Phase velocity error analysis
                  shows that the optimized pure P-wave equation is up

                  problems by fitting the synthetic and observed
                  reflection data. The shortcoming of this approach is
                  that solutions of these $\ell_2$ problems are
                  typically smoothed, tend to be overfitted, and
                  computationally too expensive because it requires
                  compared to standard RTM too many iterations. By
                  working with randomized subsets of data only, the
                  computational costs of LS-RTM can be brought down to
                  an acceptable level while producing artifact-free
                  high-resolution images without overfitting the
                  data. While initial results of these "compressive

                  issues remain including guaranteed convergence,
                  algorithmic complexity of the solver, and lack of
                  on-the-fly source estimation for LS-RTMs with
                  wave-equation solvers based on time-stepping. By
                  including on-the-fly source-time function estimation
                  into the method of Linearized Bregman (LB), on which

                  resulting in a easy-to-implement algorithm that
                  offers flexibility in the trade-off between the
                  number of iterations and the number of wave-equation
                  solves per iteration for a fixed total number of
                  wave-equation solves. Application of our algorithm
                  on a 2D synthetic shows that we are able to obtain
                  high-resolution images, including accurate estimates
                  of the wavelet, for a single pass through the
                  data. The produced image, which is by virtue of the

  abstract = {Low rank tensor completion has recently garnered the
                  attention of researchers owing to the ubiquity of
                  tensors in the sciences and the theoretical and
                  numerical challenges compared to matrix
                  completion. Here we consider a tensor completion
                  scheme where the data arises from sampling a
                  continuous function. When the sampling grid is not
                  periodic, the resulting tensor may not be low rank
                  in the Hierarchical Tucker sense, which can
                  adversely affect reconstruction quality when there
                  are missing samples. In order to compensate for this
                  off-grid sampling, we introduce a resampling
                  operator (here, the non-uniform Fourier transform)
                  that accounts for this non-uniformity moreso than
                  merely treating the sampling grid as
                  periodic. Numerical experiments demonstrate that
                  this approach can improve reconstruction quality
                  when there is relatively little data.},

  abstract = {We propose a modification to a sparsity constraint based
                  on the ratio of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms for
                  solving blind seismic deconvolution problems in
                  which the data consist of linear convolutions of
                  different sparse reflectivities with the same source
                  wavelet. We also extend the approach to the
                  Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (EPSI)
                  model, which includes surface related multiples.
                  Minimizing the ratio of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms
                  has been previously shown to promote sparsity in a
                  variety of applications including blind
                  deconvolution. Most existing implementations are
                  heuristic or require smoothing the $\ell_1/\ell_2$
                  penalty. Lifted versions of $\ell_1/\ell_2$
                  constraints have also been proposed but are
                  challenging to implement. Inspired by the lifting
                  approach, we propose to split the sparse signals
                  into positive and negative components and apply an
                  $\ell_1/\ell_2$ constraint to the difference,
                  thereby obtaining a constraint that is easy to
                  implement without smoothing the $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$
                  norms. We show that a method of multipliers
                  implementation of the resulting model can recover
                  source wavelets that are not necessarily minimum
                  phase and approximately reconstruct the sparse
                  reflectivities. Numerical experiments demonstrate
                  robustness to the initialization as well as to noise

                  Reconstruction Inversion has the advantage that the

                  gives us an unique opportunity to remove ambiguities
                  that have plagued blind deconvolution for a long
                  time. While beneficial, this feedback by itself is
                  insufficient to remove the ambiguities even with

                  waveform based inversion that helps overcome the

                  waveform based inversion methods, wavefield
                  reconstruction inversion also requires good source
                  wavelets. Without correct source wavelets,

                  In this method, we reconstruct wavefields and

                  an extended least-squares problem, which contains

                  Machine learning can be used to overcome some of
                  these challenges by fundamentally rethinking how we
                  sample and process seismic data. The key idea here
                  is to reduce acquisition and computational costs by
                  deliberately working on small randomized subsets of
                  the data at a desired accuracy. I will illustrate
                  these concepts using a variety of compelling
                  examples on realistic synthetics and field data.},

                  techniques has been recently introduced in the

                  periodically, but seismic data are typically
                  irregularly sampled along spatial axes. Other than

                  reflections are used to form image gathers and

                  remove strong coherent artifacts generated by
                  multiples that interfere with the imaged
                  reflectors. However, researchers have shown that, if
                  correctly used, multiples can actually provide extra

  abstract = {A framework is proposed for regularizing the waveform
                  inversion problem by projections onto intersections
                  of convex sets. Multiple pieces of prior information
                  about the geology are represented by multiple convex
                  sets, for example limits on the velocity or minimum
                  smoothness conditions on the model. The data-misfit
                  is then minimized, such that the estimated model is
                  always in the intersection of the convex
                  sets. Therefore, it is clear what properties the
                  estimated model will have at each iteration. This
                  approach does not require any quadratic penalties to
                  be used and thus avoids the known problems and
                  limitations of those types of penalties. It is shown
                  that by formulating waveform inversion as a
                  constrained problem, regularization ideas such as
                  Tikhonov regularization and gradient filtering can
                  be incorporated into one framework. The algorithm is
                  generally applicable, in the sense that it works
                  with any (differentiable) objective function and
                  does not require significant additional
                  computation. The method is demonstrated on the

                  synthetic seismic benchmark by Chevron using an
                  acoustic modeling code. To highlight the effect of

                  the subsurface of the earth accurately from field
                  recorded data and can be solved via the reduced
                  adjoint-state method. However, this method requires
                  access to the forward and adjoint wavefields that
                  are meet when computing gradient updates. The
                  challenge here is that the adjoint wavefield is
                  computed in reverse order during time stepping and
                  therefore requires storage or other type of
                  mitigation because storing the full time history of
                  the forward wavefield is too expensive in realistic
                  3D settings. To overcome this challenge, we propose
                  an approximate adjoint-state method where the
                  wavefields are subsampled randomly, which
                  drastically the amount of storage needed. By using
                  techniques from stochastic optimization, we control
                  the errors induced by the subsampling. Examples of
                  the proposed technique on a synthetic but realistic
                  2D model show that the subsampling-related artifacts
                  can be reduced significantly by changing the
                  sampling for each source after each model
                  update. Combination of this gradient approximation
                  with a quasi-Newton method shows virtually artifact
                  free inversion results requiring only 5% of storage
                  compared to saving the history at Nyquist. In
                  addition, we avoid having to recompute the
                  wavefields as is required by checkpointing.},

  abstract = {The use of time-lapse seismic data to monitor changes in
                  the subsurface has become standard practice in
                  industry. In addition, full-waveform inversion has
                  also been extended to time-lapse seismic to obtain
                  useful time-lapse information. The computational
                  cost of this method are becoming more pronounced as
                  the volume of data increases. Therefore, it is
                  necessary to develop fast inversion algorithms that
                  can also give improved time-lapse results. Rather
                  than following existing joint inversion algorithms,
                  we are motivated by a joint recovery model which
                  exploits the common information among the baseline
                  and monitor data. We propose a joint inversion
                  framework, leveraging ideas from distributed
                  compressive sensing and the modified Gauss-Newton
                  method for full-waveform inversion, by using the
                  shared information in the time-lapse data. Our
                  results on a realistic synthetic example highlight
                  the benefits of our joint inversion approach over a
                  parallel inversion method that does not exploit the
                  shared information. Preliminary results also
                  indicate that our formulation can address time-lapse
                  data with inconsistent acquisition geometries.},

                  changing how data is acquired and processed in many
                  fields, has attracted tremendous attention in recent
                  years. In exploration seismology, particularly in 3D
                  seismic technology, there have been published work
                  on the application of CS to seismic data
                  acquisition, processing and inversion. However, very

                  data. The case study comes from the Permian Basin in
                  Texas, USA. This dataset motivates and tests several
                  new developments in methodology that enable recovery
                  of model results that sit within multiple a priori
                  constraint sets. These constraints are imposed
                  through a Projected Quasi-Newton (PQN) approach,
                  wherein the projection set is the intersection of
                  physical property bounds and anisotropic wavenumber

  abstract = {In the well-known SRME relation, multiples are expressed
                  as the multi-dimensional convolution between the
                  subsurface Green’s function and the downgoing
                  receiver wavefield. Therefore these multiples can be
                  considered as the response of the subsurface to an
                  "areal" source term given by the same downgoing
                  receiver wavefield. This relation can be used to
                  treat these multiples as signals instead of
                  considering them as noise that must removed before
                  seismic imaging. However, when we use conventional
                  reverse-time migration to image these multiple
                  events, it results in acausal imaging artifacts
                  caused by cross-correlations between wrong pairs of
                  up- and downgoing wavefields. We find that these
                  artifacts can be removed by adopting a
                  sparsity-promoting least-squares inversion
                  approach. However, iterative inversions go at the
                  expense of excessive computational costs. By
                  combining the SRME relation and wave-equation based
                  linearized modelling, we are able to significantly
                  reduce the costs by avoiding the dense matrix-matrix
                  multiplications of SRME and the number of
                  wave-equation solves via source subsampling. As a
                  result, we arrive at a method with a cost comparable
                  to that of a single reverse-time migration with all
                  shots.},

                  parameters can vary many orders of magnitude. This
                  makes accurate estimation of multiple-parameters

                  specifically to CGMN method for solving PDEs, known
                  for being flexible (i.e. it is able to treat equally
                  acoustic data as well as visco-elastic or more
                  complex scenarios) efficient with respect both to
                  memory and computation time, and controllable
                  accuracy of the final approximation. We propose an
                  improvement for the known CGMN method by imposing a
                  minimal residual condition, which incurs in one
                  extra model vector storage. The resulting algorithm
                  called CRMN enjoys several interesting properties as
                  monotonically nonincreasing behaviour of the norm of
                  the residual and minimal residual, guaranteeing
                  optimal convergence for the relative residual
                  criterion.  We discuss numerical experiments both in
                  an isolated PDE solve and also within the inversion
                  procedure, showing that in a realistic scenario we
                  can expect a speedup around 25\% when using CRMN
                  rather than CGMN.},

                  penalty methods. While the adjoint-state method
                  involves the minimization of a data-misfit and exact
                  solutions of the wave-equation for the current
                  velocity model, the penalty-method aims to first
                  find a wavefield that jointly fits the data and
                  honours the physics, in a least-squares sense. Given
                  this reconstructed wavefield, which is a proxy for
                  the true wavefield in the true model, we calculate
                  updates for the velocity model. Aside from being
                  less nonlinear–the acoustic wave equation is linear
                  in the wavefield and model parameters but not in
                  both–the inversion is carried out over a solution
                  space that includes both the model and the
                  wavefield. This larger search space allows the
                  algortihm to circumnavigate local minima, very much
                  in the same way as recently proposed model
                  extentions try to acomplish. We include examples for
                  low frequencies, where we compare full-waveform
                  inversion results for both methods, for good and bad
                  starting models, and for high frequencies where we
                  compare reverse-time migration with linearized
                  imaging based on wavefield-reconstruction

                  representing high-dimensional tensors exhibit- ing
                  low-rank structure, to handle subsampled tensors
                  with noisy entries. We consider a "low-noise" case,
                  so that the energies of the noise and the signal are
                  nearly indistinguishable, and a ’high-noise’ case,
                  in which the noise energy is now scaled to the
                  amplitude of the entire data volume. We examine the
                  effect of the noise in terms of the singular values
                  along different matricizations of the data, i.e.,
                  reshaping of the tensor along different modes. By

                  to first estimate the autocorrelation of the unknown
                  source wavelet from the data and then recover the
                  wavelet by assuming it has minimum phase. However,
                  computing the minimum phase wavelet directly from
                  the amplitude spectrum can be sensitive to even
                  extremely small errors, especially in the
                  coefficients close to zero. Since the minimum phase
                  requirement follows from an assumption that the
                  wavelet should be as impulsive as possible, we
                  propose to directly estimate an impulsive wavelet by

                  address this issue. Most commonly, people apply
                  "data-independent" filtering operations that are
                  aimed to deemphasize the elastic phases in the data

                  observed data is not necessarily in the column space
                  of the linearized modelling operator. This can be
                  caused by lack of an accurate background velocity
                  model or by coherent noises not explained by
                  linearized modelling. Through carefully designed

                  remarkable because it results in virtually
                  artifact-free images at a cost comparable to a

                  low-rank structure. With some minor alterations to
                  existing theoretical developments, we develop an
                  optimization framework based on the geometric
                  understanding of HT tensors as a smooth manifold, a
                  generalization of smooth curves/surfaces. Building
                  on the existing research of solving optimization

                  sparse reconstruction lies a central question that
                  often goes unaddressed: is it better for the
                  transform-domain sparsity to be achieved through
                  explicit construction of sparse representations
                  (e.g., by thresholding of small transform-domain

                  return physical signals which produces sparse
                  coefficients when hit with the forward transform?
                  Recent results show that the two approaches give
                  rise to different solutions when the transform is

                  of course, is the least-squares penalty. However,
                  when outliers are present in the data, the use of
                  robust penalties such as the Huber or Student's t
                  may significantly improve the results since they put

  abstract = {There are several factors that affect the repeatability
                  of 4D(time-lapse) seismic data. One of the most
                  significant factors is the repeatability of the
                  acquisition, particularly the locations of the
                  sources and receivers. It is important to repeat the
                  source-receiver locations, used during the baseline
                  survey, in the monitor or repeat survey. Also, it is
                  essential that the stacked data volumes used for
                  time-lapse analysis are created using the same
                  offset ranges for each survey. This condition is
                  crucial in order to be able to produce an image of
                  the same location over a period of time and enhances
                  proper reservoir characterization. The cost of
                  repeating the seismic acquisition is very expensive,
                  as often times, the receiver array has to be left at
                  the same location over the period for which the data
                  will be acquired. In other words, it is important to
                  repeat the acquisition geometry as much as
                  possible. In this talk, we investigate the results
                  of changing the acquisition geometry, by a random
                  placement of the receivers for both the baseline
                  surveys and newer (monitor) surveys. Results show
                  that we are still able to observe any time-lapse
                  effects from the proposed acquisition geometry. Our
                  experiments have been performed on a synthetic

  abstract = {Source estimation is an essential component of full
                  waveform inversion. In the standard frequency domain
                  formulation, there is closed form solution for the
                  the optimal source weights, which can thus be
                  cheaply estimated on the fly. A growing body of work
                  underscores the importance of robust modeling for
                  data with large outliers or artifacts that are not
                  captured by the forward model. Effectively, the
                  least-squares penalty on the residual is replaced by
                  a robust penalty, such as Huber, Hybrid `1-`2 or
                  Student’s t. As we will demonstrate, it is essential
                  to use the same robust penalty for source
                  estimation. In this abstract, we present a general
                  approach to robust waveform inversion with robust
                  source estimation. In this general formulation,
                  there is no closed form solution for the optimal
                  source weights so we need to solve a scalar
                  optimization problem to obtain these weights.  We
                  can efficiently solve this optimization problem with
                  a Newton-like method in a few iterations. The
                  computational cost involved is of the same order as
                  the usual least-squares source estimation procedure.
                  We show numerical examples illustrating robust
                  source estimation and robust waveform inversion on
                  synthetic data with outliers.},

                  of the Hessian as, under certain conditions, a
                  pseudo-differential operator have resulted in a new
                  preconditioner by L. Demanet et al. Basing their
                  approach on a suitable basis expansion for the
                  Hessian, by suitably 'probing' the Hessian,
                  i.e. applying the Hessian to a small number of
                  randomized model perturbations, one can obtain an
                  approximation to the inverse Hessian in an efficient

  abstract = {From the measured seismic data, the location and the
                  amplitude of reflectors can be determined via a
                  migration algorithm. Classically, following
                  Claerbout{\textquoteright}s imaging principle [2], a
                  reflector is located at the position where the
                  source{\textquoteright}s forward-propagated
                  wavefield correlates with the backward-propagated
                  wavefield of the receiver data. Lailly and Tarantola
                  later showed that this imaging principle is an
                  instance of inverse problems, with the associated
                  migration operator formulated via a least-squares
                  functional; see [6, 12, 13]. Furthermore, they
                  showed that the migrated image is associated with
                  the gradient of this functional with respect to the
                  image. If the solution of the least-squares
                  functional is done iteratively, the
                  correlation-based image coincides up to a constant
                  with the first iteration of a gradient method. In
                  practice, this migration is done either in the time
                  domain or in the frequency domain. In the
                  frequency-domain migration, the main bottleneck thus
                  far, which renders its full implementation to large
                  scale problems, is the lack of efficient solvers for
                  computing wavefields. Robust direct methods easily
                  run into excessive memory requirements as the size
                  of the problem increases. On the other hand,
                  iterative methods, which are less demanding in terms
                  of memory, suffered from lack of convergence. During
                  the past years, however, progress has been made in
                  the development of an efficient iterative method [4,
                  3] for the frequency-domain wavefield
                  computations. In this paper, we will show the
                  significance of this method (called MKMG) in the
                  context of the frequency-domain migration, where
                  multi-shot-frequency wavefields (of order of 10,000
                  related wavefields) need to be computed.},

  abstract = {In recent years, data-driven multiple prediction methods
                  and wavefield extrapolation methods have proven to
                  be powerful methods to attenuate multiples from data
                  acquired in complex 3-D geologic environments.
                  These methods make use of a two-stage approach,
                  where first the multiples (surface-related and / or
                  internal) multiples are predicted before they are
                  subtracted from the original input data in an
                  adaptively. The quality of these predicted multiples
                  often raises high expectations for the adaptive
                  subtraction techniques, but for various reasons
                  these expectations are not always met in
                  practice. Standard adaptive subtraction methods use
                  the well-known minimum energy criterion, stating
                  that the total energy after optimal multiple
                  attenuation should be minimal. When primaries and
                  multiples interfere, the minimum energy criterion is
                  no longer appropriate. Also, when multiples of
                  different orders interfere, adaptive energy
                  minimization will lead to a compromise between
                  different amplitudes corrections for the different
                  orders of multiples. This paper investigates the
                  performance of two multiple subtraction schemes for
                  a real data set that exhibits both interference
                  problems. Results from an adaptive subtraction in
                  the real curvelet domain, separating primaries and
                  multiples, are compared to those obtained using a
                  more conventional adaptive subtraction method in the
                  spatial domain.},

  title = {Simply denoise: wavefield reconstruction via jittered undersampling},
  booktitle = {SINBAD 2008},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {We present a new discrete undersampling scheme designed
                  to favor wavefield reconstruction by
                  sparsity-promoting inversion with transform elements
                  that are localized in the Fourier domain. Our work
                  is motivated by empirical observations in the
                  seismic community, corroborated by recent results
                  from compressive sampling, which indicate favorable
                  (wavefield) reconstructions from random as opposed
                  to regular undersampling. As predicted by theory,
                  random undersampling renders coherent aliases into
                  harmless incoherent random noise, effectively
                  turning the interpolation problem into a much
                  simpler denoising problem. A practical requirement
                  of wavefield reconstruction with localized
                  sparsifying transforms is the control on the maximum
                  gap size. Unfortunately, random undersampling does
                  not provide such a control and the main purpose of
                  this paper is to introduce a sampling scheme, coined
                  jittered undersampling, that shares the benefits of
                  random sampling, while offering control on the
                  maximum gap size. Our contribution of jittered
                  sub-Nyquist sampling proofs to be key in the
                  formulation of a versatile wavefield
                  sparsity-promoting recovery scheme that follows the
                  principles of compressive sampling. After studying
                  the behavior of the jittered-undersampling scheme in
                  the Fourier domain, its performance is studied for
                  curvelet recovery by sparsity-promoting inversion
                  (CRSI). Our findings on synthetic and real seismic
                  data indicate an improvement of several decibels

                  curves trace the optimal trade off between these two
                  competing aims. These curves are commonly used in
                  problems with two-norm priors where they are plotted
                  on a log-log scale and are known as L-curves. For
                  other priors, such as the sparsity-promoting one
                  norm, Pareto curves remain relatively
                  unexplored. First, we show how these curves provide

                  from non-intersecting smooth interfaces, seismic
                  data can be represented by a generalized Radon
                  transform mapping the singularities in the medium to
                  seismic data. Even though seismic data are bandwidth
                  limited, signatures of the singularities in the
                  medium carry through this transform and its inverse
                  and this mapping property presents us with the

                  preserve and characterize the singularities from
                  incomplete, bandwidth-limited and noisy data. In

                  the singularities and a data-adaptive Matching
                  Pursuit method to characterize these imaged

                  first technique borrows from the ideas within the

                  almost diagonalization of the scattering operator to
                  approximately compensate for (i) the coloring of the
                  noise and hence facilitate estimation; (ii) the
                  normal operator itself. Results of applying these

                  of this curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we

  abstract = {Migration relies on multi-dimensional correlations
                  between source- and residual wavefields. These
                  multi-dimensional correlations are computationally
                  expensive because they involve operations with
                  explicit and full matrices that contain both
                  wavefields. By leveraging recent insights from
                  compressive sampling, we present an alternative
                  method where linear correlation-based imaging is
                  replaced by imaging via multidimensional
                  deconvolutions of compressibly sampled wavefields.
                  Even though this approach goes at the expense of
                  having to solve a sparsity-promotion recovery
                  program for the image, our wavefield inversion
                  approach has the advantage of reducing the system
                  size in accordance to transform-domain sparsity of
                  the image. Because seismic images also exhibit a
                  focusing of the energy towards zero offset, the
                  compressive-wavefield inversion itself is carried
                  out using a recent extension of one-norm solver
                  technology towards matrix-valued problems. These
                  so-called hybrid $(1,\,2)$-norm solvers allow us to
                  penalize pre-stack energy away from zero offset
                  while exploiting joint sparsity amongst near-offset
                  images. Contrary to earlier work to reduce modeling
                  and imaging costs through random phase-encoded
                  sources, our method compressively samples wavefields
                  in model space. This approach has several advantages
                  amongst which improved system-size reduction, and
                  more flexibility during subsequent inversions for
                  subsurface properties.},

                  identified as the main culprits responsible for this

                  exemplified by Nyquist{\textquoteright}s sampling
                  criterion, which puts disproportionate strain on
                  current acquisition and processing systems as the
                  size and desired resolution of our survey areas
                  continues to increase. Secondly, there is the recent

                  Moore{\textquoteright}s
                  law{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} that forces us
                  to lower our expectations to compute ourselves out
                  of this curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we
                  offer a way out of this situation by a deliberate

                  reduces the size of seismic data volumes without

                  environment, practitioners of seismic data
                  acquisition make all efforts to comply to this
                  theory by creating regularly-sampled seismic-data
                  volumes that are suitable for Fourier-based
                  processing flows. The current advent of new
                  alternative transform domains{\textendash}- such as
                  the sparsifying curvelet domain, where seismic data
                  is decomposed into localized, multiscale and
                  multidirectional plane waves{\textendash}- opens the
                  possibility to change this paradigm by no longer
                  combating sampling irregularity but by embracing
                  it. During this talk, we show that as long as
                  seismic data volumes permit a compressible
                  representation{\textendash}-i.e., data can be
                  represented as a superposition of relatively few
                  number of elementary waveforms{\textendash}- Nyquist
                  sampling is unnecessary pessimistic. So far, nothing
                  new, we all know from the work on Fourier- or other
                  transform-based seismic-data regularization
                  methodologies that wavefields can be recovered
                  accurately from sub-Nyquist samplings through some
                  sort of optimization procedure. What is new,
                  however, are recent insights from the field of
                  "compressive sampling", which dictate the conditions
                  that guarantee or, at least, in practice provide
                  conditions that favor sparsity-promoting recovery
                  from sub-Nyquist sampling. Random sub-sampling, or
                  to be more precise, jitter sub-sampling creates
                  favorable conditions for curvelet-based recovery. We
                  explain this phenomenon by arguing that this type of
                  sampling leads to noisy data, hence our slogan
                  "Simply denoise: wavefield reconstruction via
                  jittered undersampling", where we bank on separating
                  incoherent sub-sampling noise with curvelet-domain
                  sparsity promotion. During our presentation, we
                  introduce you to what curvelets are, why random
                  jitter sampling is important and why this opens a
                  pathway towards a new paradigm of curvelet-domain
                  seismic data processing. Our claims will be
                  supported by examples on synthetic and field
                  data. This is joint work with Gilles Hennenfent,
                  PhD. student at SLIM.},

  abstract = {In many exploration areas, successful separation of
                  primaries and multiples greatly determines the
                  quality of seismic imaging. Despite major advances
                  made by Surface-Related Multiple Elimination (SRME),
                  amplitude errors in the predicted multiples remain a
                  problem. When these errors vary for each type of
                  multiple differently (as a function of offset, time
                  and dip), these amplitude errors pose a serious
                  challenge for conventional least-squares matching
                  and for the recently introduced separation by
                  curvelet-domain thresholding. We propose a
                  data-adaptive method that corrects amplitude errors,
                  which vary smoothly as a function of location, scale
                  (frequency band) and angle. In that case, the
                  amplitudes can be corrected by an element-wise
                  curvelet-domain scaling of the predicted
                  multiples. We show that this scaling leads to a
                  successful estimation of the primaries, despite
                  amplitude, sign, timing and phase errors in the
                  predicted multiples. Our results on synthetic and
                  real data show distinct improvements over
                  conventional least-squares matching, in terms of
                  better suppression of multiple energy and

  booktitle = {AIP},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Inverse problems in (exploration) seismology are known
                  for their large to very large scale. For instance,
                  certain sparsity-promoting inversion techniques
                  involve vectors that easily exceed 230 unknowns
                  while seismic imaging involves the construction and
                  application of matrix-free discretized operators
                  where single matrix-vector evaluations may require
                  hours, days or even weeks on large compute
                  clusters. For these reasons, software development in
                  this field has remained the domain of highly
                  technical codes programmed in low-level languages
                  with little eye for easy development, code reuse and
                  integration with (nonlinear) programs that solve
                  inverse problems. Following ideas from the
                  Symes{\textquoteright} Rice Vector Library and
                  Bartlett{\textquoteright}s C++ object-oriented
                  interface, Thyra, and Reduction/Transformation
                  operators (both part of the Trilinos software
                  package), we developed a software-development
                  environment based on overloading. This environment
                  provides a pathway from in-core prototype
                  development to out-of-core and MPI
                  {\textquoteright}production{\textquoteright} code
                  with a high level of code reuse. This code reuse is
                  accomplished by integrating the out-of-core and MPI
                  functionality into the dynamic object-oriented
                  programming language Python. This integration is
                  implemented through operator overloading and allows
                  for the development of a coordinate-free solver
                  framework that (i) promotes code reuse; (ii)
                  analyses the statements in an abstract syntax tree
                  and (iii) generates executable statements. In the
                  current implementation, we developed an interface to
                  generate executable statements for the out-of-core
                  unix-pipe based (seismic) processing package
                  RSF-Madagascar (rsf.sf.net). The modular design
                  allows for interfaces to other seismic processing
                  packages and to in-core Python packages such as
                  numpy. So far, the implementation overloads linear
                  operators and elementwise reduction/transformation
                  operators. We are planning extensions towards
                  nonlinear operators and integration with existing
                  (parallel) solver frameworks such as Trilinos.},

  title = {Phase transitions in explorations seismology: statistical mechanics meets information theory},
  booktitle = {COIP},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {In this paper, two different applications of phase
                  transitions to exploration seismology will be
                  discussed. The first application concerns a phase
                  diagram ruling the recovery conditions for seismic
                  data volumes from incomplete and noisy data while
                  the second phase transition describes the behavior
                  of bi-compositional mixtures as a function of the
                  volume fraction. In both cases, the phase
                  transitions are the result of randomness in large
                  system of equations in combination with
                  nonlinearity. The seismic recovery problem from
                  incomplete data involves the inversion of a
                  rectangular matrix. Recent results from the field of
                  "compressive sensing" provide the conditions for a
                  successful recovery of functions that are sparse in
                  some basis (wavelet) or frame (curvelet)
                  representation, by means of a sparsity
                  ($\ell_1$-norm) promoting nonlinear program. The
                  conditions for a successful recovery depend on a
                  certain randomness of the matrix and on two
                  parameters that express the matrix{\textquoteright}
                  aspect ratio and the ratio of the number of nonzero
                  entries in the coefficient vector for the sparse
                  signal representation over the number of
                  measurements. It appears that the ensemble average
                  for the success rate for the recovery of the sparse
                  transformed data vector by a nonlinear sparsity
                  promoting program, can be described by a phase
                  transition, demarcating the regions for the two
                  ratios for which recovery of the sparse entries is
                  likely to be successful or likely to
                  fail. Consistent with other phase transition
                  phenomena, the larger the system the sharper the
                  transition. The randomness in this example is
                  related to the construction of the matrix, which for
                  the recovery of spike trains corresponds to the
                  randomly restricted Fourier matrix. It is shown,
                  that these ideas can be extended to the curvelet
                  recovery by sparsity-promoting inversion (CRSI). The
                  second application of phase transitions in
                  exploration seismology concerns the upscaling
                  problem. To counter the intrinsic smoothing of
                  singularities by conventional equivalent medium
                  upscaling theory, a percolation-based nonlinear
                  switch model is proposed. In this model, the
                  transport properties of bi-compositional mixture
                  models for rocks undergo a sudden change in the
                  macroscopic transport properties as soon as the
                  volume fraction of the stronger material reaches a
                  critical point. At this critical point, the stronger
                  material forms a connected cluster, which leads to
                  the creation of a cusp-like singularity in the
                  elastic moduli, which in turn give rise to specular
                  reflections. In this model, the reflectivity is no
                  longer explicitly due to singularities in the rocks
                  composition. Instead, singularities are created
                  whenever the volume fraction exceeds the critical
                  point. We will show that this concept can be used
                  for a singularity-preserved lithological upscaling.},

                  recognized as a basis that is incoherent with
                  curvelets that are known to compress seismic

                  seismic images and its invariance under the Hessian

                  preconditioning that corrects the amplitudes during

                  solution to linear inverse scattering problems based
                  on optimal basis-function decompositions. Optimality
                  of the basis functions allow us to (i) reduce the
                  dimensionality of the inverse problem; (ii) devise
                  non-linear thresholding operators that approximate
                  minimax (minimize the maximal mean square error
                  given the worst possible prior) and that
                  significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio on
                  the image. We present a reformulation of the
                  standard generalized least-squares formulation of
                  the seismic inversion problem into a formulation
                  based on thresholding, where the singular values,
                  vectors and linear estimators are replaced by
                  quasi-singular values, basis-functions and
                  thresholding. To limit the computational burden we
                  use a Monte-Carlo sampling method to compute the
                  quasi-singular values. With the proposed method, we
                  aim to significantly improve the signal-to-noise
                  ratio (SNR) on the model space and hence the
                  resolution of the seismic image. While classical
                  Tikhonov-regularized methods only gain the
                  square-root of the SNR on the data for the SNR on
                  the model our method scales almost linearly.  This
                  significant improvement of the SNR allows us to
                  discern events at high frequencies which would
                  normally be in the noise.},

  organization = {Geophysical Journal International},
  abstract = {Predictive multiple suppression methods consist of two
                  main steps: a prediction step, during which
                  multiples are predicted from seismic data, and a
                  primary-multiple separation step, during which the
                  predicted multiples are
                  {\textquoteright}matched{\textquoteright} with the
                  true multiples in the data and subsequently
                  removed. The last step is crucial in practice: an
                  incorrect separation will cause residual multiple
                  energy in the result or may lead to a distortion of
                  the primaries, or both. To reduce these adverse
                  effects, a new transformed-domain method is proposed
                  where primaries and multiples are separated rather
                  than matched. This separation is carried out on the
                  basis of differences in the multiscale and
                  multidirectional characteristics of these two signal
                  components. Our method uses the curvelet transform,
                  which maps multidimensional data volumes into almost
                  orthogonal localized multidimensional prototype
                  waveforms that vary in directional and
                  spatio-temporal content. Primaries-only and
                  multiples-only signal components are recovered from
                  the total data volume by a nonlinear optimization
                  scheme that is stable under noisy input data. During
                  the optimization, the two signal components are
                  separated by enhancing sparseness (through weighted
                  l1-norms) in the transformed domain subject to
                  fitting the observed data as the sum of the
                  separated components to within a user-defined
                  tolerance level. Whenever the prediction for the two
                  signal components in the transformed domain
                  correlate, the recovery is suppressed while for
                  regions where the correlation is small the method
                  seeks the sparsest set of coefficients that
                  represent each signal component. Our algorithm does
                  not seek a matched filter and as such it differs
                  fundamentally from traditional adaptive subtraction
                  methods. The method derives its stability from the
                  sparseness obtained by a non-parametric multiscale
                  and multidirectional overcomplete signal
                  representation. This sparsity serves as prior
                  information and allows for a Bayesian interpretation
                  of our method during which the log-likelihood
                  function is minimized while the two signal
                  components are assumed to be given by a
                  superposition of prototype waveforms, drawn
                  independently from a probability function that is
                  weighted by the predicted primaries and
                  multiples. In this paper, the predictions are based
                  on the data-driven surface-related multiple
                  elimination (SRME) method. Synthetic and field data
                  examples show a clean separation leading to a
                  considerable improvement in multiple suppression
                  compared to the conventional method of adaptive
                  matched filtering. This improved separation
                  translates into an improved stack.},

                  overcome this impediment, we argue that further

                  computational costs in par with our ability to
                  compress seismic data and images. This premise is
                  related to two recent developments. First, there is
                  the new field of compressive sensing (CS in short
                  throughout the paper, Cand{\textquoteleft}es et al.,
                  2006; Donoho, 2006){\textendash}-where the argument
                  is made, and rigorously proven, that compressible
                  signals can be recovered from severely sub-Nyquist
                  sampling by solving a sparsity promoting
                  program. Second, there is in the seismic community
                  the recent resurgence of simultaneous-source
                  acquisition (Beasley, 2008; Krohn and Neelamani,
                  2008; Herrmann et al., 2009; Berkhout, 2008;
                  Neelamani et al., 2008), and continuing efforts to
                  reduce the cost of seismic modeling, imaging, and
                  inversion through phase encoding of simultaneous
                  sources (Morton and Ober, 1998; Romero et al., 2000;

                  al., 2008) or plane waves (Vigh and Starr, 2008). By
                  using CS principles, we remove sub-sampling
                  interferences asocciated with these approaches
                  through a combination of exploiting transform-domain
                  sparsity, properties of certain sub-sampling
                  schemes, and the existence of sparsity promoting

                  discontinuities (e.g. seismic images). The advantage
                  of using curvelets is that these frames are sparse
                  for high-frequency caustic-free solutions of the
                  wave-equation. Since we are dealing with less than
                  ideal data (e.g. bandwidth-limited), we compliment
                  the curvelet frames with the discrete cosine
                  transform.  The latter is motivated by the
                  successful data continuation with the discrete
                  Fourier transform. By choosing generic basis
                  functions we circumvent the necessity to make
                  parametric assumptions (e.g., through
                  linear/parabolic Radon or demigration) regarding the
                  shape of events in seismic data. Synthetic and real
                  data examples demonstrate that our algorithm
                  provides interpolated traces that accurately
                  reproduce the wavelet shape as well as the AVO
                  behavior along events in shot gathers.},

                  fundamental shortcomings in handling increasing
                  problem sizes numerically. The so-called ``curse of

                  to an exponential growth in the number of sources

                  causes can be identified as the main culprits
                  responsible for this barrier. First, there is the
                  so-called {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}curse of
                  dimensionality{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}
                  exemplified by Nyquist{\textquoteright}s sampling
                  criterion, which puts disproportionate strain on
                  current acquisition and processing systems as the
                  size and desired resolution of our survey areas
                  continues to increase. Secondly, there is the recent
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}departure from
                  Moore{\textquoteright}s
                  law{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} that forces us
                  to lower our expectations to compute ourselves out
                  of this. In this paper, we address this situation by
                  randomized dimensionality reduction, which we adapt
                  from the field of compressive sensing. In this
                  approach, we combine deliberate randomized
                  subsampling with structure-exploiting
                  transform-domain sparsity promotion. Our approach is
                  successful because it reduces the size of seismic
                  data volumes without loss of information. With this
                  reduction, we compute Newton-like updates at the
                  cost of roughly one gradient update for the
                  fully-sampled wavefield.},

                  Curvelets/Contourlets, to various aspects of seismic
                  processing and imaging, which involve adaptive
                  subtraction. Key concepts in the approach are the
                  use of directional basis functions that localize in
                  both domains (e.g. space and angle); non-linear
                  estimation, which corresponds to localized muting on
                  the coefficients, possibly supplemented by
                  constrained optimization. We will discuss
                  applications that include multiple, ground-roll
                  removal and migration denoising. {\copyright}2004

  abstract = {Two complementary solution strategies to the
                  least-squares migration problem with sparseness- and
                  continuity constraints are proposed. The applied
                  formalism explores the sparseness of curvelets on
                  the reflectivity and their invariance under the
                  demigration-migration operator. Sparseness is
                  enhanced by (approximately) minimizing a (weighted)
                  l1-norm on the curvelet coefficients. Continuity
                  along imaged reflectors is brought out by minimizing
                  the anisotropic diffusion or total variation norm
                  which penalizes variations along and in between
                  reflectors. A brief sketch of the theory is provided

                  they enforce reciprocity. The method decomposes the
                  seismic data volume into symmetric and antisymmetric
                  parts. This decomposition leads to an augmented
                  system of equations for the L1-solver that promotes
                  sparsity in the curvelet domain. Interpolation is
                  carried out on the entire system during which the
                  asymmetric component of the volume is forced to
                  zero, while the symmetric part of the data volume is
                  matched to the measured data.},

  abstract = {Accurate removal of surface related multiples is a key
                  step in seismic data processing. The industry
                  standard for removing multiples is SRME, which
                  involves convolving the data with itself to predict
                  the multiples, followed by an adaptive subtraction
                  procedure to recover the primaries (Verschuur and
                  Berkhout, 1997). Other methods involve
                  multidimensional division of the up-going and
                  down-going wavefields (Amundsen, 2001). However,
                  this approach may suffer from stability
                  problems. With the introduction of the
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}estimation of
                  primaries by sparse
                  inversion{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}(EPSI),
                  van Groenestijn and Verschuur (2009) recentely
                  reformulated SRME to jointly estimate the
                  surface-free impulse response and the source
                  signature directly from the data. The advantage of
                  EPSI is that it recovers the primary response
                  directly, and does not require a second processing
                  step for the subtraction of estimated multiples from
                  the original data. However, because it estimates
                  both the primary impulse response and source
                  signature from the data EPSI must be regularized.
                  Motivated by recent successful application of the
                  curvelet transform in seismic data processing
                  (Herrmann et al., 2007), we formulate EPSI as a
                  bi-convex optimization problem that seeks sparsity
                  on the surface-free Green{\textquoteright}s function
                  and Fourier-domain smoothness on the source
                  wavelet. Our main contribution compared to previous
                  work (Lin and Herrmann, 2009), and the contribution
                  of that author to the proceedings of this
                  meeting(Lin and Herrmann, 2010), is that we employ
                  the physical principle of as source-receiver
                  reciprocity to improve the inversion.},

                  curvelet and surfacelet transforms to seismic data
                  processing. The first application is stable signal
                  recovery in the physical domain - seismic data
                  acquisition is often limited by physical and
                  economic constraints, and the goal is to interpolate
                  the data from a given subset of seismic traces. The
                  second application is signal recovery in a transform
                  domain - we assume that our data comes in a form of
                  a random subset of temporal frequencies and the goal
                  is to recover the missing frequencies from this
                  data. Since seismic signals are generally not
                  bandwidth limited, this in fact becomes an
                  anti-aliasing problem. In both these problems the

  abstract = {In seismic velocity inversion one aims to reconstruct a
                  kinematically correct subsurface velocity model that
                  can be used as input for further processing and
                  inversion of the data. An important tool in velocity
                  inversion is the prestack image volume. This image
                  volume can be defined as a cross-correlation of the
                  source and receivers wavefields for non-zero space
                  and time lags. If the background velocity is
                  kinematically acceptable, this image volume will
                  have its main contributions at zero lag, even for
                  complex models. Thus, it is an ideal tool for
                  wave-equation migration velocity analysis in the
                  presence of strong lateral heterogeneity. In
                  particular, it allows us to pose migration velocity
                  analysis as a PDE-constrained optimization problem,
                  where the goal is to minimize the energy in the
                  image volume at non-zero lag subject to fitting the
                  data approximately. However, it is computationally
                  infeasible to explicitly form the whole image
                  volume. In this paper, we discuss several ways to
                  reduce the computational costs involved in computing
                  the image volume and evaluating the focusing
                  criterion. We reduce the costs for calculating the
                  data by randomized source synthesis. We also present
                  an efficient way to subsample the image
                  volume. Finally, we propose an alternative
                  optimization criterion and suggest a multiscale
                  inversion strategy for wave-equation MVA.},

  abstract = {Present-day high quality 3D acquisition can give us
                  lower frequencies and longer offsets with which to
                  invert. However, the computational costs involved in
                  handling this data explosion are
                  tremendous. Therefore, recent developments in
                  full-waveform inversion have been geared towards
                  reducing the computational costs involved. A key
                  aspect of several approaches that have been proposed
                  is a dramatic reduction in the number of sources
                  used in each iteration. A reduction in the number of
                  sources directly translates to less PDE-solves and
                  hence a lower computational cost. Recent attention
                  has been drawn towards reducing the sources by
                  randomly combining the sources in to a few
                  supershots, but other strategies are also
                  possible. In all cases, the full data misfit, which
                  involves all the sequential sources, is replaced by
                  a reduced misfit that is much cheaper to evaluate
                  because it involves only a small number of sources
                  (batchsize). The batchsize controls the accuracy
                  with which the reduced misfit approximates the full
                  misfit. The optimization of such an inaccurate, or
                  noisy, misfit is the topic of stochastic
                  optimization. In this paper, we propose an
                  optimization strategy that borrows ideas from the
                  field of stochastic optimization. The main idea is
                  that in the early stage of the optimization, far
                  from the true model, we do not need a very accurate
                  misfit. The strategy consists of gradually
                  increasing the batchsize as the iterations
                  proceed. We test the proposed strategy on a
                  synthetic dataset. We achieve a very reasonable
                  inversion result at the cost of roughly 13
                  evaluations of the full misfit. We observe a
                  speed-up of roughly a factor 20.},

                  for high resolution images in complex geological
                  settings, the importance of improvements in
                  acquisition and inversion become more and more
                  critical. However, these improvements will be
                  obtained at high computational cost, as a typical
                  marine survey contains thousands of shot and
                  receiver positions, and FWI needs several passes
                  through massive seismic data. Computational cost of

                  misfit as a function of the medium

                  iterations are prohibitive because each iteration
                  requires many wave-equation simulations, which
                  without direct solvers require an expensive separate
                  solve for each source. To overcome this problem, we
                  use dimensionality-reduction to decrease the size of
                  seismic imaging problem by turning the large number
                  of sequential shots into a much small number of
                  simultaneous shots. In our approach, we take
                  advantage of sparsifying transforms to remove source
                  crosstalk resulting from randomly weighting and
                  stacking sequential shots into a few super shots. We
                  also take advantage of the fact that the convergence
                  of large-scale sparsity-promoting solvers can be
                  improved significantly by borrowing ideas from
                  message passing, which are designed to break
                  correlation built up between the linear system and
                  the model iterate. In this way, we arrive at a
                  formulation where we run the sparsity-promoting
                  solver for a relatively large number of very
                  iterations. Aside from leading to a significant
                  speed up, our approach had the advantage of greatly
                  reducing the memory imprint and IO requirements. We
                  demonstrate this feature by solving a
                  sparsity-promoting imaging problem with operators of
                  reverse-time migration, which is computationally
                  infeasible without the dimensionality reduction.},

  abstract = {In 1998 Grimbergen et. al. introduced a new method for
                  computing wavefield propagation which improved on
                  the previously employed local explicit operator
                  method in that it exhibited no dip limitation,
                  accurately handled laterally varying background
                  ground velocity models, and is unconditionally
                  stable. These desirable properties are mainly
                  attributed to bringing the propagation problem into
                  an eigenvector basis that diagonalizes the
                  propagation operators. This modal-transform method,
                  however, requires at each depth-level the solution
                  of a large-scale sparse eigenvalue problem to
                  compute the square-root of the Helmholtz
                  operator. By using recent results from compressed
                  sensing, we hope to reduce these computational costs
                  that typically involve the synthesizes of the
                  imaging operators and the cost of matrix-vector
                  products.  To reduce these costs, we compress the
                  extrapolation operators by using only a fraction of
                  the positive eigenvalues and temporal frequencies.
                  This reduction not only leads to smaller matrices
                  but also to reduced synthesis costs. These
                  reductions go at the expense of solving a recovery
                  problem from incomplete data. During the
                  presentation, we show that wavefields can accurately
                  be extrapolated with a compressed operators and
                  competitive costs.},

                  major impediment within seismic imaging. By turning
                  simulation into a compressive sensing
                  problem{\textendash}where simulated data is
                  recovered from a relatively small number of

                  remove this impediment by showing that compressively
                  sampling a simulation is equivalent to compressively
                  sampling the sources, followed by solving a reduced
                  system. As in compressive sensing, this allows for a
                  reduction in sampling rate and hence in simulation
                  costs. We demonstrate this principle for the

                  by a recovery of the full wavefield with a sparsity

                  increasing angular frequencies. These properties

                  reconstructing the primary events in a hybrid

                  multiple removal technique that belongs to the class
                  of wavefield inversion methods, as an alternative to
                  the traditional adaptive-subtraction process. The
                  main assumption is that the correct primary events
                  should be as sparsely-populated in time as
                  possible. A convex reformulation of the original
                  EPSI algorithm allows its convergence property to be
                  preserved even when the solution wavefield is not

                  non-zero-order discontinuities in the subsurface,
                  providing an additional level of robustness. This

                  popular SRME multiple removal technique called
                  Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (EPSI).
                  EPSI promises greatly improved tolerance to noise,
                  missing data, edge effect, and other physi- cal
                  phenomenon generally not described by the SRME
                  relation (van Groenestijn and Verschuur,
                  2009a,b). It is based on the premise that it is
                  possible to stably invert for both the primary
                  impulse response and the source signature despite
                  beforehand having no (or very limited) explicit
                  knowledge of latter. The key to successful
                  applications of EPSI, as shown in very recent works
                  (Savels et al., 2010), is a robust way to
                  reconstruct very sparse primary impulse response
                  events as part of the inversion process. Based on
                  the various successful demonstrations in literature,
                  there is a very strong sense that EPSI will also
                  play an important role in future developments of
                  source sig- nature deconvolution and the general

                  Amundsen inversion, where under a sparsity

                  determined directly from a data-driven wavefield
                  inversion process. One of the major difficulties in
                  its practical adoption is that one must have precise

                  multiple-free primaries during each

                  regularizing the model impulse response in the

                  sweeps. The principles of compressive sensing
                  dictates that the quality of the demultiplexed data

  abstract = {Seismic imaging typically begins with the removal of
                  multiple energy in the data, out of fear that it may
                  introduce erroneous structure. However, seismic
                  multiples have effectively seen more of the
                  earth{\textquoteright}s structure, and if treated
                  correctly can potential supply more information to a
                  seismic image compared to primaries. Past approaches
                  to accomplish this leave ample room for improvement;
                  they either require extensive modification to
                  standard migration techniques, rely too much on
                  prior information, require extensive pre-processing,
                  or resort to full-waveform inversion. We take some
                  valuable lessons from these efforts and present a
                  new approach balanced in terms of ease of
                  implementation, robustness, efficiency and
                  well-posedness, involving a sparsity-promoting
                  inversion procedure using standard Born migration
                  and a data-driven multiple modeling approach based

                  additional computational cost. Our algorithm, called
                  WSPGL1, is a modification of the spectral projected

                  for the development of a new set of design

                  algorithm is related to the IRL1 algorithm proposed

                  provide suitable information about boundaries. Sharp
                  variation of physical properties at a layer boundary
                  cause reflection the wavefield. In previous work
                  done by C. M. Dupuis, seismic signal
                  characterization is divided into two steps:
                  detection and estimation. In the detection phase,
                  the goal is to find all singularities in a seismic
                  section regardless of their order and then to
                  categorize the data to different events by windowing
                  each singularity. In the estimation step, we
                  determine the order of singularity more precisely by
                  using a rough estimate based on the detection
                  phase. Traditionally, a redundant dictionary method
                  is employed for the detection part. However, we
                  attempt to instead use a new L1-solver developed by
                  D.L. Donoho: the Stagewise Orthogonal Matching
                  Pursuit (StOMP). It approximates the solution to
                  inverse problems while promoting the sparsity in the
                  solution vector. This algorithm will allow us to
                  experimentally confirm the recent analysis by
                  S. Mallat on spiky deconvolution limits, which
                  imposes a required minimum distance between
                  spikes. This required minimum distance between
                  different spikes is dependent on the number of
                  spikes as well as the width of the chosen source
                  wavelet used in convolution with the train. These
                  results allow for the design of more robust and

                  recovering the seismic reflectivity as a sparse

  abstract = {To obtain solutions close to global minimum in waveform
                  inversion, the gradients computed at each frequency
                  need to be weighted to appropriately describe the
                  residuals between modeled and field data. While the
                  low-frequency components of the gradients should be
                  weighted to recover the long-wavelength structures,
                  the high-frequency components of the gradients need
                  to be weighted when the short-wavelength structures
                  are restored. However, the conventional elastic
                  waveform inversion algorithms cannot properly weight
                  the gradients computed at each frequency. When
                  gradients are scaled using the pseudo-Hessian matrix
                  inside the frequency loop, gradients obtained at
                  high frequencies are over-emphasized. When the
                  gradients are scaled outside the frequency loop,
                  gradients are weighted by the source spectra. In
                  this study, we propose applying weighting factors to
                  the gradients obtained at each frequency so that
                  gradients can properly reflect the differences
                  between the true and assumed models satisfying the
                  general inverse theory. The weighting factors are
                  composed by the backpropagated residuals. Numerical
                  examples for the simple rectangular-shaped model and
                  the modified version of the Marmousi-2 model show
                  that the weighting method enhances gradient images

                  at each frequency are not properly weighted

                  waveform inversion algorithms using the

                  and are designed to handle data that can not be
                  operated on in memory. Each base operation is
                  created as a main program that reads data from disk
                  and writes the result to disk. The main programs can
                  also be chained together on stdin/out pipes using a
                  shell only writing data to disk at the end. To be
                  efficient, the algorithm using an OOCE must chain
                  together the longest pipe to avoid disk I/O, as a
                  result it is very difficult to use iterative
                  techniques. The algorithms are written in shell
                  scripts can be difficult to read and understand.
                  SLIMpy is a software library that contains
                  definitions of coordinate free vectors and linear
                  operators. It allows the user to design and run
                  algorithms with any out of core package, in a Matlab
                  style interface while maintaining optimal efficiency
                  and speed. SLIMpy looks at each main program of each
                  OOCE as a Matrix vector operation or vector
                  reduction/transformation operation. It uses operator
                  overloading to generate an abstract syntax tree
                  (AST) which can be optimized in many ways before
                  executing its commands. The AST also provides a
                  pathway for embarrassingly parallel applications by
                  splitting the tree over different nodes and
                  processors. SLIMpy provides an interface to these
                  OOCE that allows for optimal construction of
                  commands and allows for iterative techniques. It
                  smoothes the transition from other languages such as
                  Matlab and allows the algorithm designer to write
                  readable and reusable code. SLIMpy also adds to OOCE

  abstract = {Seismic traces are sampled irregularly and
                  insufficiently due to practical and economical
                  limitations. The use of such data in seismic imaging
                  results in image artifacts and poor spatial
                  resolution. Therefore, before being used, the
                  measurements are to be interpolated onto a regular
                  grid. One of the methods achieving this objective is
                  based on the Fourier reconstruction, which deals
                  with the under-determined system of equations. The
                  recent pursuit techniques (namely, basis pursuit,
                  matching pursuit etc) admit certain promising
                  features such as faster and simpler implementation
                  even in large scale settings.  The presentation
                  discusses the application of the pursuit algorithms
                  to the Fourier-based interpolation problem for the

                  particular, the objective of the presentation

                  algorithm if, and how far, the measurement
                  coordinates can be shifted from uniform distribution
                  on the continuous interval. 2). studying what could
                  be the allowable misplacement in the measurement
                  coordinates that does not alter the quality of the
                  reconstruction process},

                  one often uses seismic data with missing traces. The
                  use of such data results in image artifacts and poor
                  spatial resolution. Sometimes due to practical
                  limitations, measurements may be available on a
                  perturbed grid, instead of on the designated
                  grid. Due to algorithmic requirements, when such
                  measurements are viewed as those on the designated
                  grid, the recovery procedures may result in
                  additional artifacts. This paper interpolates
                  incomplete data onto regular grid via the Fourier
                  domain, using a recently developed greedy
                  algorithm. The basic objective is to study
                  experimentally as to what could be the size of the
                  perturbation in measurement coordinates that allows
                  for the measurements on the perturbed grid to be
                  considered as on the designated grid for faithful
                  recovery. Our experimental work shows that for
                  compressible signals, a uniformly distributed
                  perturbation can be offset with slightly more number

                  by Sparsity-promoting Inversion (CRSI) has been
                  developed, and has proven to be useful for seismic
                  data processing. One of the most important issues
                  for CRSI is the sampling scheme, which can greatly
                  affect the quality of reconstruction. Unlike usual
                  regular undersampling, stochastic sampling can
                  convert aliases to easy-to-eliminate noise. Some
                  stochastic sampling methods have been developed for
                  CRSI, e.g. jittered sampling, however most have only
                  been applied to 1D sampling along a line. Seismic
                  datasets are usually higher dimensional and very
                  large, thus it is desirable and often necessary to
                  develop higher dimensional sampling methods to deal
                  with these data. For dimensions higher than one, few
                  results have been reported, except uniform random
                  sampling, which does not perform well. In the
                  present paper, we explore 2D sampling methodologies
                  for curvelet-based reconstruction, possessing
                  sampling spectra with blue noise characteristics,
                  such as Poisson Disk sampling, Farthest Point
                  Sampling, and the 2D extension of jittered
                  sampling. These sampling methods are shown to lead
                  to better recovery and results are compared to the
                  other more traditional sampling protocols.},

  abstract = {With the growing realization that multiples can provide
                  valuable information, there is a paradigm shift from
                  removing them to using them. For instance, primary
                  estimation by sparse inversion has demonstrated its
                  superiority over surface-related multiple removal in
                  many aspects. Inspired by this shift, we propose a
                  method to image directly from the total up-going
                  wavefield, including surface-related multiples, by
                  sparse inversion. To address the high computational
                  cost associated with this method, we propose to
                  speed up the inversion by having the wave-equation
                  solver carry out the multi-dimensional convolutions
                  implicitly and cheaply by randomized subsampling. We
                  improve the overall performance of this algorithm by
                  selecting new independent copies of the randomized
                  modeling operator, which leads to a cancellation of
                  correlations that hamper the speed of convergence of
                  the solver. We show the merits of our approach on a
                  number of examples.},

  abstract = {Multiples, especially the surface-related multiples,
                  form a significant part of the total up-going wave-
                  field. If not properly dealt with, they can lead to
                  false reflectors in the final image. So
                  conventionally practitioners remove them prior to
                  migration. Recently research has revealed that
                  multiples can actually provide extra illumination so
                  different methods are proposed to address the issue
                  that how to use multiples in seismic imaging, but
                  with various kinds of limitations. In this abstract,
                  we combine primary estimation and sparsity-promoting
                  migration into one convex-optimization process to
                  include information from multiples. Synthetic
                  examples show that multiples do make active
                  contributions to seismic migration. Also by this
                  combination, we can benefit from better recoveries
                  of the Greens function by using sparsity-promoting
                  algorithms since reflectivity is sparser than the

                  high cost of acquisition work and collection of
                  massive data volumes compel the adoption of
                  simultaneous-source seismic data acquisition - an
                  emerging technology that is developing rapidly,
                  stimulating both geophysical research and commercial
                  efforts. Aimed at improving the performance of
                  marine- and land-acquisition crews, simultaneous
                  acquisition calls for development of a new set of
                  design principles and post-processing
                  tools. Leveraging developments from the field of
                  compressive sensing the focus here is on
                  simultaneous-acquisition design and
                  sequential-source data recovery. Apart from proper
                  compressive sensing sampling schemes, the recovery
                  from simultaneous simulations depends on a
                  sparsifying transform that compresses seismic data,
                  is fast, and reasonably incoherent with the
                  compressive-sampling matrix. Using the curvelet
                  transform, in which seismic data can be represented
                  parsimoniously, the recovery of the
                  sequential-source data volumes is achieved using the
                  sparsity-promoting program {\textemdash} SPGL1, a
                  solver based on projected spectral gradients. The
                  main outcome of this approach is a new technology
                  where acquisition related costs are no longer

                  effective. One of the common problems with removal
                  of surface waves is that they tend to be aliased in
                  the frequency domain. This can make removal

                  reflector signals, as this signals will not be

                  basis-function techniques becomes apparent when we
                  use these decompositions to adaptively substract
                  modeled ground roll from data using a non-linear
                  thesholding procedure. We show real and synthetic
                  examples and the results suggest that these
                  directional-selective basis functions provide a
                  usefull tool for the removal of coherent noise such
                  as ground roll.},

  abstract = {We present theoretical results pertaining to the ability
                  of p-(quasi)norm minimization to recover sparse and
                  compressible signals from incomplete and noisy
                  measurements. In particular, we extend the results
                  of Candes, Romberg and Tao for 1-norm to the p $\ll$
                  1 case. Our results indicate that depending on the
                  restricted isometry constants and the noise level,
                  p-norm minimization with certain values of p $\ll$ 1
                  provides better theoretical guarantees in terms of
                  stability and robustness compared to 1-norm
                  minimization. This is especially true when the
                  restricted isometry constants are relatively large,
                  or equivalently, when the data is significantly
                  undersampled.},
