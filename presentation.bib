  abstract = {Amplitude vs. angle analysis (AVA) of pre-stack seismic
                  data is a commonly used method for inferring
                  petrophysical information from seismic
                  data. Conventionally, a two-term linearized rock
                  physics model (Shuey equation) is used to invert
                  angle-domain common-image gathers. Multivariate
                  analysis of the inverted terms leads to a background
                  of siliciclastic interfaces, where outlying points
                  are associated with hydrocarbon saturated sands.
                  The acquisition and processing of seismic data does
                  not result in highly-calibrated measurements that
                  adhere to the rock physics model, which often
                  inhibits the success of AVA analysis. We offer an
                  alternative approach that uses PCA-based methods to
                  learn projections directly from the data without the
                  need of a physical model. Results on synthetic and
                  field data show that PCA-based projections can
                  improve segmentation of potential reservoirs in
                  seismic data.},

  title = {Efficient approach for quantifying uncertainty of wavefield reconstruction inversion},
  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Due to the noisy measurements, sparse observations,
                  uncertain forward models, and uncertain prior
                  parameter information, significant uncertainty
                  arises in the inverted velocity model of
                  full-waveform inversion. The uncertain velocity
                  model leads to the uncertainty in the correct
                  positions of events in the migrated images, which
                  subsequently influences the important
                  decision-makings in the oil and gas exploration and
                  production (E&P) business such as the drilling
                  decisions and economic evaluations. Therefore,
                  understanding the uncertainty in the inverted
                  velocity model is essential for the mitigation of
                  the E&P risks. A common approach to accounting for
                  uncertainty in seismic inverse problems like
                  full-waveform inversion is to describe the unknown
                  parameters in probabilistic by the Bayesian
                  inference. The Bayesian inference aims at
                  incorporating the information from the data,
                  physics, and one’s prior knowledge to formulate a
                  posterior distribution function to characterize the
                  statistical properties of the unknown
                  parameters. However, characterizing uncertainties
                  for the large-scale full-waveform inversion in
                  seismic exploration is prohibitively expensive since
                  it requires thousands of function evaluations to
                  sample the parameter space (e.g. via Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo sampling). Apart from this, the existing
                  methods of uncertainty quantification for
                  full-waveform inversion is through applying the
                  Bayesian inference to the standard method such as
                  the adjoint-state method with the assumption that no
                  uncertainty arises from the wave-equation. However,
                  the wave-equation may not be able to reflect all the
                  physics, hence, incorporating uncertainty from
                  wave-equation might benefit the quantification of
                  uncertainty. In this work, we propose to perform
                  uncertainty quantification using the recently
                  proposed wavefield reconstruction inversion
                  technique, which gives an appropriate framework to
                  tackle the uncertainty in wave-equation solve by
                  adding the misfit of the wave-equation to the
                  likelihood distribution and relaxing the
                  wave-equation constraint. Moreover, we propose a
                  computationally feasible approach to analyzing the
                  posterior distribution of the wavefield
                  reconstruction inversion method, which incorporates
                  a Gaussian distribution that approximates the
                  posterior distribution with an optimization-driven
                  Gaussian simulator to sample the Gaussian
                  distribution efficiently. Numerical examples show
                  that comparing to the McMC method, our approach is
                  able to produce comparable results with less
                  computational cost. This is joint work with Curt da

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion is challenging in complex
                  geological areas. Even when provided with an
                  accurate starting model, the inversion algorithms
                  often struggle to update the velocity
                  model. Contrary to other areas in applied
                  geophysics, including prior information in
                  full-waveform inversion is still relatively in its
                  infancy. In part this is due to the fact that
                  incorporating prior information that relates to
                  geological settings where strong discontinuities in
                  the velocity model dominate is difficult, because
                  these settings call for non-smooth
                  regularizations. We tackle this problem by including
                  constraints on the spatial variations and value
                  ranges of the inverted velocities, as opposed to
                  adding penalties to the objective as is more
                  customary in main stream geophysical inversion. By
                  demonstrating the lack of predictability of
                  edge-preserving inversion when the regularization is
                  in the form of an added penalty term, we advocate
                  the inclusion of constraints instead. Our examples
                  show that the latter lead to more predictable
                  results and to significant improvements in the

  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Seismic data collection is becoming challenging because
                  of increased demands for high-quality, long-offset
                  and wide-azimuth data. Leveraging ideas from CS, in
                  this work we establish a cost effective acquisition
                  and processing techniques, which are no longer
                  dominated by survey area size but by the sparsity of
                  seismic data volumes. In the first part of abstract,
                  we establish connections between random time
                  dithering and jittered sampling in
                  space. Specifically, we recover high-quality 5D
                  seismic data volumes from time-jittered marine
                  acquisition where the average inter-shot time is
                  significantly reduced, leading to cheaper surveys
                  due to fewer overlapping shots. The time-jittered
                  acquisition, in conjunction with the shot separation
                  by Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD)-free
                  factorization based rank-minimization approach,
                  allows us to recover high quality 5D seismic data
                  volumes. Results are illustrated for simulations of
                  simultaneous time-jittered continuous recording for
                  a 3D ocean-bottom cable survey, where we outperforms
                  existing techniques, by an order of magnitude
                  computational speedup and using 1/20th of the
                  memory, that use sparsity in transforms domains. The
                  second part of abstract focussed on leveraging
                  low-rank structure in seismic data to solve
                  extremely large data recovery (interpolation)
                  problems. We introduced a large–scale SVD-free
                  optimization framework that is robust with respect
                  to outliers and that uses information on the
                  support. We test the efficacy of the proposed
                  interpolation framework on a large-scale 5D seismic
                  data, generated from the geologically complex
                  synthetic 3D Compass velocity model, where 80\% of
                  the data has been removed. Our findings show that
                  major computational and memory gains are possible

  abstract = {Conventional oil and gas fields are increasingly
                  difficult to explore and produce, which calls for
                  more complex wave-equation based inversion (WEI)
                  algorithms that require dense long-offset
                  samplings. These requirements result in an
                  exponential growth in data volumes and prohibitive
                  demands on computational resources. In this work, we
                  propose a fast, resilient, and scalable
                  wave-equation based inversion methodology for both
                  the data and image-domain, which can handle
                  complicated wave physics. First we show that both
                  the data and image domains exhibit low-rank
                  structure in a transform-domain, which can be
                  exploited to compress the dense data or image
                  volumes. Then, by accessing information from the
                  compressed volumes on-the fly, we devise a scalable
                  computational inversion framework driven by gradient
                  calculations, which works with small subsets of
                  source experiments. In the full-waveform inversion

                  interpolation to improve downstream inversion
                  results compared to merely inverting the velocity
                  model using the subsampled data volume directly. We

                  an independent system of simpler sub-problems that
                  can be handled in parallel. The methodology is
                  flexible, where the approach can be adapted to the

                  including classical operators such as forward
                  modelling and linearised forward (Born) modelling as

                  the PDE to a wavefield instead of applying its
                  inverse. We will also show that the performance

                  industrial software libraries (10\% faster on the

                  for solving non-linear inverse problems than
                  penalized problem formulations. So far we used
                  constraints which can be represented as convex sets,
                  for which most optimization theory is
                  developed. Some non-convex counterparts of convex
                  sets are introduced and examples show that the

                  with non-convex sets. The motivation to also explore
                  non-convex sets, is that they sometimes translate

  abstract = {Microseismic waves generated by hydraulic fracturing are
                  used to locate the fractures created in the
                  reservoir. Most of the existing source collocation
                  methods have their limitations in terms of
                  resolution of very closely spaced microseismic
                  events. In this work we propose a method to
                  collocate microseismic events with high resolution
                  along with simultaneous estimation of source time
                  function. In the context of waves, the
                  finite-difference modelling operator acts as an
                  analysis operator for wavefields. This implies that
                  wavefields under the action of a finite-difference
                  modelling kernel can be focused to sources
                  generating these wavefields. We exploit this
                  property of wavefields to locate microseismic events
                  and estimate the source time function jointly. To
                  arrive at a computational feasible scheme, we use
                  the accelerated version of Linearized Bregman (LBR)

                  conventional adjoint-state formulations, Wavefield
                  Reconstruction Inversion has the advantage that the
                  Gauss-Newton Hessian is well approximated by a
                  diagonal scaling, which allows us to add convex
                  constraints, such as the box- and the
                  edge-preserving total-variation constraint, on the
                  square slowness without incurring significant
                  increases in computational costs. As the examples
                  demonstrate, including these constraints yields far
                  superior results in complex geological areas that
                  contain high-velocity high-contrast bodies
                  (e.g. salt or basalt). Without these convex
                  constraints, adjoint-state and Wavefield
                  Reconstruction Inversion get trapped in local minima

  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},

  abstract = {Compared to more mundane blind deconvolution problems,
                  blind deconvolution in seismic applications involves
                  a feedback mechanism related to the free surface.
                  The presence of this feedback mechanism gives us an
                  unique opportunity to remove ambiguities that have
                  plagued blind deconvolution for a long time. While
                  beneficial, this feedback by itself is insufficient
                  to remove the ambiguities even with L1
                  constraints. However, when paired with an L1/L2
                  constraint the feedback allows us to resolve the
                  scaling ambiguity under relatively mild
                  assumptions. Inspired by lifting approaches, we
                  propose to split the sparse signal into positive and
                  negative components and apply an \ell_1/\ell_2
                  constraint to the difference, thereby obtaining a
                  constraint that is easy to implement.  Numerical
                  experiments demonstrate robustness to the

  abstract = {A framework is proposed for regularizing the waveform
                  inversion problem by projections onto intersections
                  of convex sets. Multiple pieces of prior information
                  about the geology are represented by multiple convex
                  sets, for example limits on the velocity or minimum
                  smoothness conditions on the model. The data-misfit
                  is then minimized, such that the estimated model is
                  always in the intersection of the convex
                  sets. Therefore, it is clear what properties the
                  estimated model will have at each iteration. This
                  approach does not require any quadratic penalties to
                  be used and thus avoids the known problems and
                  limitations of those types of penalties. It is shown
                  that by formulating waveform inversion as a
                  constrained problem, regularization ideas such as
                  Tikhonov regularization and gradient filtering can
                  be incorporated into one framework. The algorithm is
                  generally applicable, in the sense that it works
                  with any (differentiable) objective function and
                  does not require significant additional
                  computation. The method is demonstrated on the

  abstract = {We propose a modification to a sparsity constraint based
                  on the ratio of l1 and l2 norms for solving blind
                  seismic deconvolution problems in which the data
                  consist of linear convolutions of different sparse
                  reflectivities with the same source wavelet. No
                  assumptions are made about the location of the
                  support of either the wavelet or the sparse
                  signals. Minimizing the ratio of l1 and l2 norms has
                  been previously shown to promote sparsity in a
                  variety of applications including blind
                  deconvolution. Most existing implementations are
                  heuristic or require smoothing the l1/l2
                  penalty. Lifted versions of l1/l2 constraints have
                  also been proposed but are still challenging to
                  implement. Inspired by the lifting approach, we
                  propose to split the sparse signals into positive
                  and negative components and apply an l1/l2
                  constraint to the difference, thereby obtaining a
                  constraint that is easy to implement without
                  smoothing the l1 or l2 norms. We show that a method
                  of multipliers implementation of the resulting model
                  can recover source wavelets that are not necessarily
                  minimum phase and approximately reconstruct the
                  sparse reflectivities. It appears to be robust to
                  the initialization and to small amounts of noise in
                  the data. We also discuss extensions to the
                  Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (EPSI)

                  are often spatially undersampled due to economical
                  reasons as well as ground surface
                  limitations. Operational conditions might result in
                  noisy traces or even gaps in coverage and irregular
                  sampling which often leads to image

  abstract = {In this presentation, we extend our previous work in
                  Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor completion, which
                  uses an extremely efficient representation for
                  representing high-dimensional tensors exhibiting
                  low-rank structure, to handle subsampled tensors
                  with noisy entries. We consider a `low-noise' case,
                  so that the energies of the noise and the signal are
                  nearly indistinguishable, and a `high-noise' case,
                  in which the noise energy is now scaled to the
                  amplitude of the entire data volume. For the
                  low-noise case in particular, standard
                  trace-by-trace energy comparisons cannot distinguish
                  noise from signal. We examine the behaviour of noise
                  in terms of the singular values along different
                  matricizations of the data, i.e. reshaping of the
                  tensor along different dimensions. By interpreting
                  this effect in the context of tensor completion, we
                  demonstrate the inefficacy of denoising by this
                  method in the source-receiver domain. In light of
                  this observation, we transform the decimated, noisy
                  data in to the midpoint-offset domain, which
                  promotes low-rank behaviour in the signal and
                  high-rank behaviour in the noise. This distinction
                  between signal and noise allows low-rank
                  interpolation to effectively denoise the signal,
                  without knowledge of the noise location, with only a
                  marginal increase in computational cost. We

                  full-space constrained methods and reduced-space
                  unconstrained methods. Instead of eliminating the
                  constraint, which leads to the reduced adjoint-state
                  method that underpins most formulations of
                  full-waveform inversion, our method relaxes the PDE
                  constraint by replacing it by an additive
                  (least-squares) penalty term. By using the method of
                  variable projection, we arrive at a formulation that
                  alternates between solving for the wavefield, given
                  the velocity model & data, and solving for
                  velocity-model updates, given the wavefields. We
                  named this method Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion
                  (WRI) because it inverts for the model updates by
                  reconstructing the wavefield everywhere given data

  abstract = {For many full-waveform inversion techniques, the most
                  computationally intensive step is the computation of
                  a numerical solution for the wave equation on every
                  iteration. In the frequency domain approach, this
                  requires the solution of very large, complex,
                  sparse, ill-conditioned linear systems. In this
                  abstract we bring out attention specifically to CGMN
                  method for solving PDEs, known for being flexible
                  (i.e. it is able to treat equally acoustic data as
                  well as visco-elastic or more complex scenarios)
                  efficient with respect both to memory and
                  computation time, and controllable accuracy of the
                  final approximation. We propose an improvement for
                  the known CGMN method by imposing a minimal residual
                  condition, which incurs in one extra model vector
                  storage. The resulting algorithm called CRMN enjoys
                  several interesting properties as monotonically
                  nonincreasing behaviour of the norm of the residual
                  and minimal residual, guaranteeing optimal
                  convergence for the relative residual criterion. We
                  discuss numerical experiments both in an isolated
                  PDE solve and also within the inversion procedure,
                  showing that in a realistic scenario we can expect a

  abstract = {In this talk I consider the problem of inverting
                  waveforms for multiple medium parameters. The
                  governing PDE is chosen to be the Helmholtz equation
                  with compressibility and buoyancy as the
                  unknowns. Both unknowns occur in the same equation
                  and practice has shown it is very hard to estimate
                  both equally accurate; the buoyancy estimate (or
                  density if a slightly different parametrization is
                  used) is typically much smoother than the
                  compressibility (or velocity). Here I introduce a
                  new waveform inversion algorithm: a full Newton-type
                  method based on a penalty method which adds the PDE
                  constraint as a quadratic penalty term. This method
                  updates both the 'wavefields' and medium parameters,
                  without explicitly solving PDE's. One of the main
                  advantages is the availability of a sparse Hessian
                  and exact gradient which are not the result of any
                  PDE solves. We asses if the availability of the
                  Hessian, which includes information about the
                  coupling between the two medium parameters, can help
                  reconstruct both compressibility and buoyancy.},

  abstract = {An implementation of seismic wave simulation on a
                  platform consisting of a conventional host processor
                  and a reconfigurable hardware accelerator is
                  presented. This research is important in the field
                  of exploration for oil and gas resources, where a 3D
                  model of the subsurface is frequently required. By
                  comparing seismic data collected in a real-world
                  survey with synthetic data generated by simulated
                  waves, it is possible to deduce such a
                  model. However this requires many time-consuming
                  simulations with different Earth models to find the
                  one that best fits the measured data. Speeding up
                  the wave simulations would allow more models to be
                  tried, yielding a more accurate estimate of the
                  subsurface. The reconfigurable hardware accelerator
                  employed in this work is a field programmable gate
                  array (FPGA). FPGAs are computer chips that consist
                  of electronic building blocks that the user can
                  configure and reconfigure to represent their
                  algorithm in hardware. Whereas a traditional
                  processor can be viewed as a pipeline for processing
                  instructions, an FPGA is a pipeline for processing
                  data. The chief advantage of the FPGA is that all
                  the instructions in the algorithm are already
                  hardwired onto the chip. This means that execution
                  time depends only on the amount of data to be
                  processed, and not on the complexity of the
                  algorithm. The main contribution is an
                  implementation of the well-known Kaczmarz row
                  projection algorithm on the FPGA, using techniques
                  of dataflow programming. This kernel is used as the
                  preconditioning step of CGMN, a modified version of
                  the conjugate gradients method that is used to solve
                  the time-harmonic acoustic isotropic constant
                  density wave equation. Using one FPGA accelerator,
                  the current implementation allows seismic wave
                  simulations to be performed over twice as fast,
                  compared to running on one Intel Xeon E5-2670
                  core. I also discuss the effect of modifications of
                  the algorithm necessitated by the hardware on the
                  convergence properties of CGMN. Finally, a specific
                  plan for future work is set-out in order to fully
                  exploit the accelerator platform, and my work is set

                  approach will suffer from the detrimental effects of
                  cycle skipping if the starting model is
                  inaccurate. We reformulate FWI so that it instead
                  adapts the predicted data to the observed data using
                  Wiener filters, and then iterates to improve the
                  model by forcing the Wiener filters towards zero-lag
                  delta functions. This adaptive FWI scheme is
                  demonstrated on synthetic data where it is shown to
                  be immune to cycle skipping, and is able to invert
                  successfully data for which conventional FWI fails

                  frequencies or a highly accurate starting model to
                  be successful. Adaptive FWI has some features in

                  that the wave-equation needs to be solved
                  exactly. The basic workflow of this new method is as
                  follows; i) solve an overdetermined wave-equation
                  (the data-augmented wave-equation), where the data
                  serves as additional constraints for the wavefields,

  abstract = {Solution of the Helmholtz equation is the main
                  computational burden of full-waveform inversion in
                  the frequency domain. For this task we employ the
                  CARP-CG algorithm (Gordon & Gordon 2010), an
                  iterative solver that preconditions the original
                  Helmholtz system into an equivalent symmetric
                  positive definite system and then applies the method
                  of conjugate gradients. Forming the matrix for the
                  new system is not necessary as its multiplicative
                  action on a vector is implemented using a series of
                  projections onto the rows of the original
                  system. Our contribution is implementing CARP-CG for
                  a host + accelerator (FPGA) computing
                  environment. The computational paradigm is one of
                  dataflow: vector and matrix elements are streamed
                  from memory through the accelerator which applies
                  the row projections. The advantage of an FPGA to
                  process streams of data is that unless the algorithm
                  is memory bandwidth limited, computation time is
                  directly proportional to the amount of data. The
                  complexity of the algorithm implemented on the FPGA
                  is irrelevant since all the operations programmed
                  onto the FPGA happen in the same clock tick. In
                  contrast, on a CPU, more complex algorithms require
                  more clock ticks as the instructions are executed
                  sequentially, or with only a small amount of
                  parallelism. Ongoing work porting the CARP-CG
                  algorithm to the accelerator is presented.},

                  proposed to fit a subset of the data's

                  completion. This interpolation theory consists of
                  three components major signal structure,
                  structure-destroying sampling, and
                  structure-restoring optimization. By viewing
                  interpolation in the context of this theory, we are
                  able to specify exactly when these approaches are
                  expected to perform well. We also introduce
                  structure-revealing transformations that promote the
                  inherent low-rank structure in seismic data as well
                  as a factorization approach that scales to large
                  problem sizes. Our methods are able to handle
                  large-scale data volumes more accurately and more
                  quickly compared to other more ad-hoc approaches, as

                  optimization formulation used in seismic waveform
                  inversion is based on calculating the gradient of
                  the data misfit objective functional via the

                  estimates of subsurface medium parameters, such as
                  soundspeed, from seismic data. A formulation in the
                  frequency-domain leads to an optimization problem
                  constrained by a Helmholtz equation with many
                  right-hand sides. Application of this technique in
                  3D precludes the use of factorization techniques to
                  solve the Helmholtz equation due the large number of
                  gridpoints and the bandwidth of the matrix. While
                  many sophisticated pre-conditioned iterative
                  techniques have been developed for the Helmholtz
                  equation, they often include model-specific tuning
                  parameters and are thus not very attractive for
                  inversion since the medium parameters change from
                  one iteration to the next. In this paper, we propose
                  a method for 3D seismic waveform inversion that
                  addresses both the need to efficiently solve the
                  Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost
                  induced by the many right-hand sides. To solve the
                  Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic
                  preconditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is
                  well-suited for inversion because of its
                  robustness. We extend this method to a
                  block-iterative method that can efficiently handle
                  multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the
                  computational cost of of the overall optimization
                  procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from
                  stochastic optimization that allow us to work with
                  approximate gradient information. These
                  approximations are obtained by evaluating only a
                  small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by
                  solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics
                  to adaptively determine the required accuracy of the
                  PDE solves and the sample-size and illustrate the

                  problems that occur in (geophysical) inversion
                  problems. The method takes measured data from a
                  physical system as input and minimizes an objective
                  function that depends on an unknown model for the
                  physical parameters, fields, and additional nuisance
                  parameters such as the source function. The
                  invention consists of a minimization procedure
                  involving a cost functional comprising of a
                  data-misfit term and a penalty term that measures
                  how accurately the fields satisfy the PDE. The
                  method is composed of two alternating steps, namely
                  the solution of a system of equations forming the
                  discretization of the data-augmented PDE, and the
                  solution of physical model parameters from the PDE
                  itself given the field that solves the

                  PDE-constrained optimization, there is no need to
                  update and store the fields for all sources leading

                  initial estimates for the physical model
                  parameters. Contrary to the reduced formulation, the
                  proposed method does not require the solution of an
                  adjoint PDE, effectively halving the number of PDE
                  solves and memory requirement. As in the reduced
                  formulation, fields can be computed independently
                  and aggregated, possibly in parallel.},

                  high-dimensional tensors exhibiting particular
                  low-rank structure. With some minor alterations to
                  existing theoretical developments, we develop an
                  optimization framework based on the geometric
                  understanding of HT tensors as a smooth manifold, a
                  generalization of smooth curves/surfaces. Building
                  on the existing research of solving optimization
                  problems on smooth manifolds, we develop Steepest
                  Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods for HT
                  tensors. The resulting algorithms converge quickly,
                  are immediately parallelizable, and do not require
                  the computation of SVDs. We also derive efficient
                  Gauss-Newton based algorithms which converge much
                  faster than standard, first-order methods. We also
                  extend ideas about favourable sampling conditions
                  for missing-data recovery from the field of Matrix
                  Completion to Tensor Completion and demonstrate how
                  the organization of data can affect the success of
                  recovery. As a result, if one has data with randomly
                  missing source pairs, using these ideas, coupled
                  with an efficient solver, one can interpolate
                  large-scale seismic data volumes with missing
                  sources and/or receivers by exploiting the
                  multidimensional dependencies in the data. We are
                  able to recover data volumes amidst extremely high
                  subsampling ratios (in some cases, > 75\%) using this
                  approach and we demonstrate our recovery on a

  abstract = {Wave-equation based inversions, such as full-waveform
                  inversion, are challenging because of their
                  computational costs, memory requirements, and
                  reliance on accurate initial models. To confront
                  these issues, we propose a novel formulation of
                  full-waveform inversion based on a penalty
                  method. In this formulation, the objective function
                  consists of a data-misfit term and a penalty term
                  which measures how accurately the wavefields satisfy
                  the wave-equation. Because we carry out the
                  inversion over a larger search space, including both
                  the model and synthetic wavefields, our approach
                  suffers less from local minima. Our main
                  contribution is the development of an efficient
                  optimization scheme that avoids having to store and
                  update the wavefields by explicit
                  elimination. Compared to existing optimization
                  strategies for full-waveform inversion, our method
                  differers in two main aspects; i. The wavefields are
                  solved from an augmented wave-equation, where the
                  solution is forced to solve the wave-equation and
                  fit the observed data, ii. no adjoint wavefields are
                  required to update the model, which leads to
                  significant computational savings. We demonstrate
                  the validity of our approach by carefully selected

                  gridpoints and the bandwidth of the matrix. While
                  many sophisticated pre-conditioned iterative
                  techniques have been developed for the Helmholtz
                  equation, they often include model-specific tuning
                  parameters and are thus not very attractive for
                  inversion since the medium parameters change from
                  one iteration to the next. In this paper, we propose
                  a method for 3D seismic waveform inversion that
                  addresses both the need to efficiently solve the
                  Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost
                  induced by the many right-hand-sides. To solve the
                  Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic
                  preconditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is
                  well-suited for inversion because of its
                  robustness. We extend this method to a
                  block-iterative method that can efficiently handle
                  multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the
                  computational cost of of the overall optimization
                  procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from
                  stochastic optimization that allow us to work with
                  approximate gradient information. These
                  approximations are obtained by evaluating only a
                  small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by
                  solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics
                  to adaptively determine the required accuracy of the
                  PDE solves and the sample-size and illustrate the
                  algorithms on synthetic benchmark models. This is
                  joint work with Tristan van Leeuwen.},

                  important tool for migration-velocity and
                  amplitude-versus-angle analysis in areas of complex
                  geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of
                  as multidimensional correlations of the source and
                  receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing the
                  gathers lies in the fact that one needs to store and
                  compute these wavefields and in correlating the
                  wavefields to obtain the desired image
                  gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically
                  only computed for a limited number of subsurface
                  points and for a limited range of subsurface
                  offsets. In this presentation, we offer a new
                  perspective on such gathers by organizing the
                  extended image as a function of all subsurface
                  offsets for all subsurface points in a matrix whose
                  (i,j) entry captures the interaction between
                  gridpoints i and j. Of course, it is infeasible to
                  form and store this matrix. Instead, we propose an
                  efficient algorithm to glean information from the
                  image volume via the action of matrix-vector
                  products with this matrix. We illustrate how this

  abstract = {Recent developments in matrix rank optimization have
                  allowed for new computational approaches in the
                  field of seismic data interpolation.  One of the
                  main requirements of exploiting rank-minimization
                  approaches is that the target data set should
                  exhibit a low-rank structure. Seismic frequency
                  slices exhibit low-rank structure at the
                  low-frequencies, but not at the high
                  frequencies. This behavior is due to the increase in
                  oscillations as we move from low to high-frequency
                  slices, even though the energy remains focused
                  around the diagonal. Therefore, interpolation via
                  rank minimization in the high-frequency range
                  requires extended formulations that incorporate
                  low-rank structure. We propose an approach for
                  seismic data interpolation which incorporates the
                  Hierarchical Semi-Separable Structure (HSS) inside
                  rank-regularized least-squares formulations for the
                  missing-trace interpolation problem. The proposed
                  approach is suitable for large scale problems, since
                  it avoids SVD computations and uses a low-rank
                  factorized formulation instead. We illustrate the
                  advantages of the new HSS approach by interpolating
                  a seismic line from the Gulf of Suez and compare the
                  reconstruction with conventional rank minimization.},

  abstract = {Over the years we have investigated seismic data
                  interpolation and redatuming algorithms rely on on
                  the assumption that seismic records and images
                  permit sparse approximations under certain
                  representations, such as Curvelet
                  coefficients. Recent findings have suggested that
                  for redundant representations (of which Curvelet is
                  an example), the analysis operator that maps the
                  physical signal to coefficients may also play a
                  crucial role in recovering data from incomplete
                  observations. This insight elevates the significance
                  of a question that often goes unaddressed: is it
                  better for the transform-domain sparsity to be
                  achieved through explicit construction of sparse
                  representations (e.g., by thresholding of small
                  transform-domain coefficients), or by demanding that
                  the algorithm return physical signals which produces
                  sparse coefficients when hit with the forward
                  transform? Recent results show that the two
                  approaches give rise to different solutions when the
                  transform is redundant, and that the latter approach
                  imposes a whole new class of constraints. In
                  particular, the number of zero-valued coefficients
                  given by the analysis operator acting on the signal,
                  referred to as its "cosparsity", have an analogous
                  role to the sparsity of the signal in terms of the
                  coefficients. From this framework, a new
                  reconstruction algorithm is proposed which may allow
                  better reconstruction from subsampled signaled than
                  what the sparsity assumption alone would predict. In
                  this work we apply the new framework and algorithm
                  to the case of seismic data interpolation under the
                  curvelet domain, and show that it admits better
                  reconstruction than some existing L1 sparsity-based
                  methods derived from compressive sensing for a range
                  of subsampling factors. We will also investigate
                  different analysis operators and their impact on
                  both sparsity and cosparsity-based algorithms.},

                  sets, and designing algorithms to interpolate the
                  missing data at very large scales poses a daunting
                  and critical challenge.  We study how to apply
                  scalable matrix completion methods to such
                  interpolation problems.  Recent studies in matrix
                  completion have shown that a matrix that has low
                  rank can be exactly completed when only a small
                  number of observations are available. However, there
                  are two challenges to applying matrix completion to
                  seismic data. Matrix completion is typically applied
                  to two dimensional or dyadic data whereas seismic
                  data is often tensorial. Also successful matrix
                  completion requires a low-rank matrix structure. We
                  address these problems by organizing the seismic
                  data on a matrix grid which exhibits a low-rank
                  structure. This encoding allows us to apply the
                  Jellyfish algorithm, developed at the University of
                  Wisconsin, which achieves state-of-the-art

  abstract = {There has been a swell of research in the scientific
                  computing community in the last couple of years
                  which tries to extend notions of linear algebra
                  (rank, the SVD, linear systems, etc.) to higher
                  dimensional arrays, or tensors. Much work has been
                  proposed to try to overcome the so called "curse of
                  dimensionality", the O(N^d) storage required for a
                  d-dimensional array, where N is the size of each
                  dimension. The hierarchical Tucker format is one
                  such tensor representation which manages to
                  decompose a hierarchy of dimensions into parameter
                  matrices of very manageable size, requiring at most
                  dNK + (d - 2)K^3 + K^2 parameters, where K is an
                  internal rank parameter. In this work, we extend
                  ideas of matrix completion to the tensor case, where
                  we only know a small number of randomly distributed
                  entries from various 4D frequency slices, and try to
                  recover the fully sampled tensor based on the
                  knowledge that it has low hierarchical tucker rank
                  in a particular arrangement of dimensions. Using
                  this approach, we exploit the multi-dimensional
                  dependencies within the full data in order to
                  achieve very promising interpolation results even
                  from heavily subsampled data.},

                  seismology increasingly relies on more and more
                  sophisticated algorithms that require multiple paths

                  because the size of seismic data volumes is
                  increasing exponentially, exposing bottlenecks in IO
                  and computational capability. To overcome these
                  bottlenecks, we follow recent trends in machine

                  regularly sampled wavefields from periodically
                  sampled data with gaps caused by physical
                  constraints. While transform-domain sparsity
                  promotion has proven to be an effective tool to
                  solve this recovery problem, current recovery
                  techniques make no use of a priori information on
                  the transform-domain coefficients. To overcome these
                  vulnerabilities in solving the recovery problem for
                  large-scale problems, we propose recovery by
                  weighted one-norm minimization, which exploits
                  correlations between locations of significant
                  coefficients of different partitions, e.g., shot
                  records, common-offset gathers, or frequency slices,
                  of the acquired data. Moreover, in situations where
                  no prior support estimate is available, we propose
                  the WSPGL1 algorithm that outperforms standard
                  $\ell_1$ minimization in finding sparse solutions to
                  underdetermined linear systems of equations. Our
                  algorithm is a modification of the SPGL1 algorithm
                  and enjoys better sparse recovery performance at no
                  additional computational cost. We illustrate the

                  the wave equation in the frequency domain are two
                  competing approaches to modelling. Frequency domain
                  approaches can further be categorized as using
                  either direct or iterative solvers. For 3D FWI,
                  iterative solvers in the frequency domain are
                  attractive, partly because they require less memory
                  than the other methods. This is due to the fact that
                  there is no need to store the wavefield at each time
                  step, or compute a factorization of the Helmholtz
                  operator that will not be as sparse as the original
                  matrix. One iterative solver that has been applied
                  to the Helmholtz equation is CARP-CG. CARP-CG uses
                  Kaczmarz row projections for each block of a domain

                  applying it to a four-component ocean-bottom survey
                  over the Tommeliten Alpha field in the North
                  Sea. This shallow-water data set provides good
                  azimuthal coverage to offsets of 7 km, with reduced
                  coverage to a maximum offset of about 11 km. The
                  reservoir lies at the crest of a high-velocity
                  antiformal chalk section, overlain by about 3000 m
                  of clastics within which a low-velocity gas cloud
                  produces a seismic obscured area. We inverted only
                  the hydrophone data, and we retained free-surface
                  multiples and ghosts within the field data. We
                  invert in six narrow frequency bands, in the range 3
                  to 6.5 Hz. At each iteration, we selected only a
                  subset of sources, using a different subset at each
                  iteration; this strategy is more efficient than
                  inverting all the data every iteration. Our starting
                  velocity model was obtained using standard PSDM
                  model building including anisotropic reflection
                  tomography, and contained epsilon values as high as
                  20\%. We have also attempted full-elastic inversion
                  of these data to recover a shallow isotropic model
                  of both p and s-wave velocities. The final FWI
                  velocity model shows a network of shallow
                  high-velocity channels that match similar features
                  in the reflection data. Deeper in the section, the
                  FWI velocity model reveals a sharper and
                  more-intense low-velocity region associated with the
                  gas cloud in which low-velocity fingers match the
                  location of gas-filled faults visible in the

                  provides a better match to well logs, and better
                  flattens common image gathers, than does the
                  starting model. Reverse-time migration, using the

                  the migrated image, simplifying the planform of the

                  The conventional FWI approach is expensive since it
                  requires the inversion of a linear system, which
                  involves extremely large multi-experiment data
                  volumes. To overcome this issue we percent a
                  curvetlet based sparsity-promoting Gauss-Newton
                  inversion method. In this presentation we invert for
                  the model updates by replacing the normal

                  gradually increasing grid size as we move to higher
                  frequencies. Our approach is successful because it
                  reduces the size of seismic data volumes without

                  compute a Newton-like update with the reduced data

                  principle here is to use prior knowledge about the
                  signal to be recovered, e.g., approximate locations
                  of large-in-magnitude transform coefficients, if
                  such information is available. An example for this
                  is the use of weighted 1-norm minimization to
                  improve wavefield reconstruction from randomized
                  (sub)sampling. We will review these results and
                  outline some new directions we have explored during
                  the last year, such as weighted non-convex sparse
                  recovery (see Ghadermarzy's talk), weighted
                  analysis-based recovery (see Hargreaves's talk), and
                  a weighted randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for solving
                  large overdetermined systems of equations that are
                  known to admit a (nearly) sparse solution. Various
                  examples in seismic will be shown.},
