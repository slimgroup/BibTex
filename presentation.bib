  abstract = {Random subsampling is increasingly being used in the acquisition of seismic data to shorten the acquisition time and to reduce costs. However, the design of optimal acquisition geometries is still an ongoing area of research. Matrix completion (MC) is a computationally efficient method to reconstruct fully sampled wavefields from sparsely sampled seismic data. In MC theory, the spectral gap (SG), which is a measure of the connectedness of the graph in expander graph theory, has been used to predict, and to some degree quantify, the quality of wavefield reconstruction, given a specific subsampling scheme (acquisition mask). Building on these insights, we propose an optimization scheme, based on simulated annealing, which finds subsampling masks with large SGs that improve the quality of wavefield reconstruction with MC. The experimental results show that the proposed method successfully increases the SG of the subsampling mask starting from randomly initialized masks. Increasing the SG leads to improved connectivity between the sources and receivers and therefore of the wavefield reconstruction. Numerical experiments confirm a direct relationship between increased SG and improved reconstruction quality. This confirms the value SG analysis brings to the design of seismic surveys without the need to carry out expensive wavefield reconstructions to optimize the acquisition design.},

  booktitle = {ML4SEISMIC Partners Meeting},
  year = {2021},
  month = {11},
  abstract = {In inverse problems, uncertainty quantification (UQ) deals with a probabilistic description of the solution nonuniqueness and data noise sensitivity. Setting seismic imaging into a Bayesian framework allows for a principled way of studying uncertainty by solving for the model posterior distribution. Imaging, however, typically constitutes only the first stage of a sequential workflow, and UQ becomes even more relevant when applied to subsequent tasks that are highly sensitive to the inversion outcome. In this paper, we focus on how UQ trickles down to horizon tracking for the determination of stratigraphic models and investigate its sensitivity with respect to the imaging result. As such, the main contribution of this work consists in a data-guided approach to horizon tracking uncertainty analysis. This work is fundamentally based on a special reparameterization of reflectivity, known as “deep prior”. Feasible models are restricted to the output of a convolutional neural network with a fixed input, while weights and biases are Gaussian random variables. Given a deep prior model, the network parameters are sampled from the posterior distribution via a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, from which the conditional mean and point-wise standard deviation of the inferred reflectivities are approximated. For each sample of the posterior distribution, a reflectivity is generated, and the horizons are tracked automatically. In this way, uncertainty on model parameters naturally translates to horizon tracking. As part of the validation for the proposed approach, we verified that the estimated confidence intervals for the horizon tracking coincide with geologically complex regions, such as faults.},

Bayesian inference for ill-posed inverse problems is challenged by the high-dimensionality of the unknown, computationally expensive forward operator, and choosing a prior distribution that accurately encodes prior knowledge on the unknown. To handle this situation and to assess uncertainty, we propose to approximate the posterior distribution using a pretrained conditional normalizing flow, which is trained on existing low- and high-fidelity estimations of the unknown. To further improve the accuracy of this approximation, we use transfer learning and finetune this normalizing flow by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predicted and the desired high-fidelity posterior density. This amounts to minimizing a physic-based variational inference objective with respect to the network weights, which we believe might scale better than Bayesian inference with Markov Chain sampling methods. We apply the proposed Bayesian inference approach to seismic imaging where we use quasi-real data obtained from the Parihaka dataset.},

We propose a novel solution that is both scalable and less sensitive to starting models or inaccurate parameters (such as anisotropy) that are typically kept fixed during inversion. It is based on a dual reformulation of the classical wavefield reconstruction inversion, whose empirical robustness with respect to these issues is well documented in the literature. While the classical version is not suited to 3D, as it leverages expensive frequency-domain solvers for the wave equation, our proposal allows the deployment of state-of-the-art time-domain finite-difference methods, and is potentially mature for industrial-scale problems.},

This necessitates uncertainty quantification to communicate to practitioners which areas of the image can be trusted. We propose a framework which leverages a machine learning based method (Conditional Normalizing Flows) to learn the full posterior distribution of viable solutions given the time-reversal adjoint solution. We show that areas of calculated uncertainty correlate with structures that are known to be difficult to image. In addition, we also propose a MAP based solution, which solves the variational least-squares problem while using the trained Conditional Normalizing Flow as a prior distribution.},

Until now, FNOs have been limited to small problems, as their memory intensive design makes them difficult to scale in a traditional machine learning setting on a single computer or GPU. In this work, a decomposition scheme is described and implemented in PyTorch using the DistDL distributed deep learning framework, which is capable of scaling FNOs to arbitrary dimension and input size running on many nodes in a distributed memory system. This parallel implementations allows FNOs to be trained and run on problems of a practical scale on both CPU and GPU clusters.},

ill-conditioned inverse problems due to the inherent nonuniqueness of the

Unfortunately, it is often not possible to formulate a prior distribution
that precisely encodes our prior knowledge about the unknown. Furthermore,
adherence to handcrafted priors may greatly bias the outcome of the Bayesian
analysis. To address this issue, we propose to use the functional form of a
randomly initialized convolutional neural network as an implicit structured
prior, which is shown to promote natural images and excludes images with
unnatural noise. In order to incorporate the model uncertainty into the final
estimate, we sample the posterior distribution using stochastic gradient
Langevin dynamics and perform Bayesian model averaging on the obtained
samples. Our synthetic numerical experiment verifies that deep priors
combined with Bayesian model averaging are able to partially circumvent
imaging artifacts and reduce the risk of overfitting in the presence of
extreme noise. Finally, we present pointwise variance of the estimates as a
measure of uncertainty, which coincides with regions that are more difficult
to image.},

  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Most conventional 3D time-lapse (or 4D) acquisitions are ocean-bottom cable (OBC) or ocean-bottom node (OBN) surveys since these surveys are relatively easy to replicate compared to towed-streamer surveys. To attain high degrees of repeatability, survey replicability and dense periodic sampling has become the norm for 4D surveys that renders this technology expensive. Conventional towed-streamer acquisitions suffer from limited illumination of subsurface due to narrow azimuth. Although, acquisition techniques such as multi-azimuth, wide-azimuth, rich-azimuth acquisition, etc., have been developed to illuminate the subsurface from all possible angles, these techniques can be prohibitively expensive for densely sampled surveys. This leads to uneven sampling, i.e., dense receiver and coarse source sampling or vice-versa, in order to make these acquisitions more affordable. Motivated by the design principles of Compressive Sensing (CS), we acquire economic, randomly subsampled (or compressive) and simultaneous towed-streamer time-lapse data without the need of replicating the surveys. We recover densely sampled time-lapse data on one and the same periodic grid by using a joint-recovery model (JRM) that exploits shared information among different time-lapse recordings, coupled with a computationally cheap and scalable rank-minimization technique. The acquisition is low cost since we have subsampled measurements (about 70% subsampled), simulated with a simultaneous long-offset acquisition configuration of two source vessels travelling across a survey area at random azimuths. We analyze the performance of our proposed compressive acquisition and subsequent recovery strategy by conducting a synthetic, at scale, seismic experiment on a 3D time-lapse model containing geological features such as channel systems, dipping and faulted beds, unconformities and a gas cloud. Our findings indicate that the insistence on replicability between surveys and the need for OBC/OBN 4D surveys can, perhaps, be relaxed. Moreover, this is a natural next step beyond the successful CS acquisition examples discussed during this session.},

  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Unlike conventional reservoirs, unconventional plays are not naturally viable for economical production of oil and gas. They require stimulation by injecting high-pressure fluid causing fractures in the rocks. These fractures make the medium more permeable, hence, the extraction of oil and gas becomes feasible. For drilling purposes and to prevent potentially hazardous situations, we need to have good knowledge of the location of these fractures. Also, we need to have good knowledge about how these fractures originated in time. Hydraulic fracturing changes stress in rocks, which results in the emission of microseismic waves. The opening of cracks due to high pressure fluid injection during hydraulic fracturing mainly causes this change in stress in the rocks. Therefore, microseismic events are mostly localized along these fractures and have finite energy along time. To accurately track the evolution of fractures in both space and time, we need to locate closely spaced microseismic events along these fractures activating at very small time intervals. A naive approach can be the back propagation of the observed data to find out a point in space and time where maximum focusing of back propagating energy occurs. This point corresponds to the location and origin time of a microseismic source. This approach, although simpler, suffers from low resolution and requires scanning of complete 4D volume (3D in space and 1D in time). Hence, this method can be challenging when there are multiple closely spaced microseismic sources originating at different times. We in this work propose a sparsity promotion based method that can locate closely spaced microseismic events, with spatial separation as low as within half a wavelength, activating at small time intervals. We simultaneously estimate the origin time of microseismic events by estimating their source time functions. Our method exploits the fact that microseismic events are localized in space and have finite energy. We use accelerated Linearized Bregman algorithm with a preconditioning operator to arrive at a computationally feasible scheme.},

Compared to Wavefields Reconstruction Inversion, the new formulation mitigates the difficulty of choosing the penalty parameter λ. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we develop an efficient frequency domain algorithm that alternatively updates the model and the data. Numerical experiments confirm strong stability of the proposed method by comparisons between the results of our algorithm with that from both plain FWI and a weighted formulation of the FWI.

In Marine data however, these applications rely on the success of a pre-imaging separation of primaries and multiples, which can be modeled as a multi-dimensional convolution between the vertical derivative of the surface-free Green’s function and the down-going receiver wavefield. Instead of imaging the primaries and multiples separately, we implement the LS-RTM of the total down-going wavefield by combining areal source injection and linearized Born modelling, where strong surface related multiples are generated from a strong density variation at the ocean bottom. The advantage including surface related multiples in LS-RTM is the extra illumination we obtain from these multiples without incurring additional computational costs related to carrying out multi-dimensional convolutions part of conventional multiple prediction procedures. Even though we are able to avert these computational costs, our approach shares the large costs of LS-RTM. We reduce these costs by combining randomized source subsampling with our sparsity-promoting imaging technology, which produces artifact-free, high-resolution images, with the surface-related multiples migrated properly.},

These strict requirements lead to massive data volume size and prohibitive demands on computational resources. In this work, we propose to compress our dense data in hierarchical Tucker tensor format by exploiting the low-rank structure of the data in a transformed domain. Then, we devise on-the-fly common shot or receiver gather extraction directly via the highly compressed factors. In subsampling scenarios, by interpolating this novel tensor format, we can also reconstruct the shot or receiver gather on a per-query basis rather than expanding the data to its fully-sampled form. We demonstrate the effective performance of our proposed technique on 3D stochastic full-waveform inversion, which allows the stochastic algorithm to extract shot gathers as it requires them throughout the inversion process. Moreover, we finally show how to computational effectively generate the CIGs from this compressed low-rank tensor representation of the data with the help of fast simultaneous shot or receiver gather generation.},

  title = {Efficient approach for quantifying uncertainty of wavefield reconstruction inversion},
  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Due to the noisy measurements, sparse observations,
                  uncertain forward models, and uncertain prior
                  parameter information, significant uncertainty
                  arises in the inverted velocity model of
                  full-waveform inversion. The uncertain velocity
                  model leads to the uncertainty in the correct
                  positions of events in the migrated images, which
                  subsequently influences the important
                  decision-makings in the oil and gas exploration and
                  production (E&P) business such as the drilling
                  decisions and economic evaluations. Therefore,
                  understanding the uncertainty in the inverted
                  velocity model is essential for the mitigation of
                  the E&P risks. A common approach to accounting for
                  uncertainty in seismic inverse problems like
                  full-waveform inversion is to describe the unknown
                  parameters in probabilistic by the Bayesian
                  inference. The Bayesian inference aims at
                  incorporating the information from the data,
                  physics, and one’s prior knowledge to formulate a
                  posterior distribution function to characterize the
                  statistical properties of the unknown
                  parameters. However, characterizing uncertainties
                  for the large-scale full-waveform inversion in
                  seismic exploration is prohibitively expensive since
                  it requires thousands of function evaluations to
                  sample the parameter space (e.g. via Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo sampling). Apart from this, the existing
                  methods of uncertainty quantification for
                  full-waveform inversion is through applying the
                  Bayesian inference to the standard method such as
                  the adjoint-state method with the assumption that no
                  uncertainty arises from the wave-equation. However,
                  the wave-equation may not be able to reflect all the
                  physics, hence, incorporating uncertainty from
                  wave-equation might benefit the quantification of
                  uncertainty. In this work, we propose to perform
                  uncertainty quantification using the recently
                  proposed wavefield reconstruction inversion
                  technique, which gives an appropriate framework to
                  tackle the uncertainty in wave-equation solve by
                  adding the misfit of the wave-equation to the
                  likelihood distribution and relaxing the
                  wave-equation constraint. Moreover, we propose a
                  computationally feasible approach to analyzing the
                  posterior distribution of the wavefield
                  reconstruction inversion method, which incorporates
                  a Gaussian distribution that approximates the
                  posterior distribution with an optimization-driven
                  Gaussian simulator to sample the Gaussian
                  distribution efficiently. Numerical examples show
                  that comparing to the McMC method, our approach is
                  able to produce comparable results with less
                  computational cost. This is joint work with Curt da

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion is challenging in complex
                  geological areas. Even when provided with an
                  accurate starting model, the inversion algorithms
                  often struggle to update the velocity
                  model. Contrary to other areas in applied
                  geophysics, including prior information in
                  full-waveform inversion is still relatively in its
                  infancy. In part this is due to the fact that
                  incorporating prior information that relates to
                  geological settings where strong discontinuities in
                  the velocity model dominate is difficult, because
                  these settings call for non-smooth
                  regularizations. We tackle this problem by including
                  constraints on the spatial variations and value
                  ranges of the inverted velocities, as opposed to
                  adding penalties to the objective as is more
                  customary in main stream geophysical inversion. By
                  demonstrating the lack of predictability of
                  edge-preserving inversion when the regularization is
                  in the form of an added penalty term, we advocate
                  the inclusion of constraints instead. Our examples
                  show that the latter lead to more predictable
                  results and to significant improvements in the

  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Seismic data collection is becoming challenging because
                  of increased demands for high-quality, long-offset
                  and wide-azimuth data. Leveraging ideas from CS, in
                  this work we establish a cost effective acquisition
                  and processing techniques, which are no longer
                  dominated by survey area size but by the sparsity of
                  seismic data volumes. In the first part of abstract,
                  we establish connections between random time
                  dithering and jittered sampling in
                  space. Specifically, we recover high-quality 5D
                  seismic data volumes from time-jittered marine
                  acquisition where the average inter-shot time is
                  significantly reduced, leading to cheaper surveys
                  due to fewer overlapping shots. The time-jittered
                  acquisition, in conjunction with the shot separation
                  by Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD)-free
                  factorization based rank-minimization approach,
                  allows us to recover high quality 5D seismic data
                  volumes. Results are illustrated for simulations of
                  simultaneous time-jittered continuous recording for
                  a 3D ocean-bottom cable survey, where we outperforms
                  existing techniques, by an order of magnitude
                  computational speedup and using 1/20th of the
                  memory, that use sparsity in transforms domains. The
                  second part of abstract focussed on leveraging
                  low-rank structure in seismic data to solve
                  extremely large data recovery (interpolation)
                  problems. We introduced a large–scale SVD-free
                  optimization framework that is robust with respect
                  to outliers and that uses information on the
                  support. We test the efficacy of the proposed
                  interpolation framework on a large-scale 5D seismic
                  data, generated from the geologically complex
                  synthetic 3D Compass velocity model, where 80\% of
                  the data has been removed. Our findings show that
                  major computational and memory gains are possible
                  compared to curvelet-based reconstruction.},

  abstract = {Conventional oil and gas fields are increasingly
                  difficult to explore and produce, which calls for
                  more complex wave-equation based inversion (WEI)
                  algorithms that require dense long-offset
                  samplings. These requirements result in an
                  exponential growth in data volumes and prohibitive
                  demands on computational resources. In this work, we
                  propose a fast, resilient, and scalable
                  wave-equation based inversion methodology for both
                  the data and image-domain, which can handle
                  complicated wave physics. First we show that both
                  the data and image domains exhibit low-rank
                  structure in a transform-domain, which can be
                  exploited to compress the dense data or image
                  volumes. Then, by accessing information from the
                  compressed volumes on-the fly, we devise a scalable
                  computational inversion framework driven by gradient
                  calculations, which works with small subsets of
                  source experiments. In the full-waveform inversion
                  context, we demonstrate the efficacy of low-rank
                  interpolation to improve downstream inversion
                  results compared to merely inverting the velocity
                  model using the subsampled data volume directly. We

                  framework on two different waveform-inversion
                  formulations, specifically performing full-waveform
                  inversion on 5D data set generated using the
                  overthrust model, and wave-equation based migration

                  for solving non-linear inverse problems than

  abstract = {Microseismic waves generated by hydraulic fracturing are
                  used to locate the fractures created in the

                  methods have their limitations in terms of
                  resolution of very closely spaced microseismic
                  events. In this work we propose a method to
                  collocate microseismic events with high resolution
                  along with simultaneous estimation of source time
                  function. In the context of waves, the
                  finite-difference modelling operator acts as an
                  analysis operator for wavefields. This implies that

                  The presence of this feedback mechanism gives us an

                  plagued blind deconvolution for a long time. While

                  techniques for seismic data interpolation to the
                  “off-the-grid” case, wherein the data is not
                  acquired on a regularly-spaced grid. This irregular
                  sampling scheme causes the underlying tensor to
                  become high-rank, thus preventing our previous
                  Hierarchical Tucker tensor algorithms from
                  successfully recovering the volume. Instead of
                  applying these techniques naively, we introduce a
                  fictitious, regular grid on which the volume
                  exhibits low-rank behaviour and a resampling
                  operator that interpolates the data from the
                  regular, low-rank domain to the irregular sampling
                  domain. By incorporating these changes in to our

                  sampled data volumes with costs determined primarily
                  by the choice of resampling transform. In our case,

  abstract = {A framework is proposed for regularizing the waveform
                  inversion problem by projections onto intersections
                  of convex sets. Multiple pieces of prior information
                  about the geology are represented by multiple convex
                  sets, for example limits on the velocity or minimum
                  smoothness conditions on the model. The data-misfit
                  is then minimized, such that the estimated model is
                  always in the intersection of the convex
                  sets. Therefore, it is clear what properties the
                  estimated model will have at each iteration. This
                  approach does not require any quadratic penalties to
                  be used and thus avoids the known problems and
                  limitations of those types of penalties. It is shown
                  that by formulating waveform inversion as a
                  constrained problem, regularization ideas such as
                  Tikhonov regularization and gradient filtering can
                  be incorporated into one framework. The algorithm is
                  generally applicable, in the sense that it works
                  with any (differentiable) objective function and
                  does not require significant additional
                  computation. The method is demonstrated on the

                  consist of linear convolutions of different sparse

                  support of either the wavelet or the sparse
                  signals. Minimizing the ratio of l1 and l2 norms has
                  been previously shown to promote sparsity in a
                  variety of applications including blind
                  deconvolution. Most existing implementations are

                  reasons as well as ground surface
                  limitations. Operational conditions might result in
                  noisy traces or even gaps in coverage and irregular
                  sampling which often leads to image
                  artifacts. Seismic trace interpolation aims to

                  means. First we use wave-equation solvers to
                  implicitly carry out the expensive dense
                  matrix-matrix multiplications in the prediction of
                  surface-related multiples. Second we bring down the
                  simulation cost by subsampling the frequencies and
                  monochromatic source experiments together with
                  curvelet-domain sparsity-promoting and
                  rerandomization. As a result, we obtain
                  true-amplitude least-squares migrated seismic images
                  with computational costs that are comparable to a
                  single RTM with all the data. We demonstrate the
                  efficacy of the proposed method using realistic

  booktitle = {SINBAD Spring consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {In this presentation, we extend our previous work in
                  Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor completion, which
                  uses an extremely efficient representation for
                  representing high-dimensional tensors exhibiting
                  low-rank structure, to handle subsampled tensors
                  with noisy entries. We consider a `low-noise' case,
                  so that the energies of the noise and the signal are
                  nearly indistinguishable, and a `high-noise' case,
                  in which the noise energy is now scaled to the
                  amplitude of the entire data volume. For the
                  low-noise case in particular, standard
                  trace-by-trace energy comparisons cannot distinguish
                  noise from signal. We examine the behaviour of noise
                  in terms of the singular values along different
                  matricizations of the data, i.e. reshaping of the
                  tensor along different dimensions. By interpreting
                  this effect in the context of tensor completion, we
                  demonstrate the inefficacy of denoising by this
                  method in the source-receiver domain. In light of
                  this observation, we transform the decimated, noisy
                  data in to the midpoint-offset domain, which
                  promotes low-rank behaviour in the signal and
                  high-rank behaviour in the noise. This distinction
                  between signal and noise allows low-rank
                  interpolation to effectively denoise the signal,
                  without knowledge of the noise location, with only a
                  marginal increase in computational cost. We
                  demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a
                  4D frequency slice.},

                  unconstrained methods. Instead of eliminating the

                  method that underpins most formulations of
                  full-waveform inversion, our method relaxes the PDE

                  (least-squares) penalty term. By using the method of

                  computationally intensive step is the computation of
                  a numerical solution for the wave equation on every
                  iteration. In the frequency domain approach, this
                  requires the solution of very large, complex,
                  sparse, ill-conditioned linear systems. In this
                  abstract we bring out attention specifically to CGMN
                  method for solving PDEs, known for being flexible
                  (i.e. it is able to treat equally acoustic data as

                  nonincreasing behaviour of the norm of the residual
                  and minimal residual, guaranteeing optimal
                  convergence for the relative residual criterion. We
                  discuss numerical experiments both in an isolated
                  PDE solve and also within the inversion procedure,
                  showing that in a realistic scenario we can expect a
                  speedup around 25\% when using CRMN rather than
                  CGMN. Joint work with Art Petrenko, Zhilong Fang,

  abstract = {In this talk I consider the problem of inverting
                  waveforms for multiple medium parameters. The
                  governing PDE is chosen to be the Helmholtz equation
                  with compressibility and buoyancy as the
                  unknowns. Both unknowns occur in the same equation
                  and practice has shown it is very hard to estimate
                  both equally accurate; the buoyancy estimate (or
                  density if a slightly different parametrization is
                  used) is typically much smoother than the
                  compressibility (or velocity). Here I introduce a
                  new waveform inversion algorithm: a full Newton-type
                  method based on a penalty method which adds the PDE
                  constraint as a quadratic penalty term. This method
                  updates both the 'wavefields' and medium parameters,
                  without explicitly solving PDE's. One of the main
                  advantages is the availability of a sparse Hessian
                  and exact gradient which are not the result of any
                  PDE solves. We asses if the availability of the
                  Hessian, which includes information about the
                  coupling between the two medium parameters, can help
                  reconstruct both compressibility and buoyancy.},

  abstract = {An implementation of seismic wave simulation on a
                  platform consisting of a conventional host processor
                  and a reconfigurable hardware accelerator is
                  presented. This research is important in the field
                  of exploration for oil and gas resources, where a 3D
                  model of the subsurface is frequently required. By
                  comparing seismic data collected in a real-world
                  survey with synthetic data generated by simulated
                  waves, it is possible to deduce such a
                  model. However this requires many time-consuming
                  simulations with different Earth models to find the
                  one that best fits the measured data. Speeding up
                  the wave simulations would allow more models to be
                  tried, yielding a more accurate estimate of the
                  subsurface. The reconfigurable hardware accelerator
                  employed in this work is a field programmable gate
                  array (FPGA). FPGAs are computer chips that consist
                  of electronic building blocks that the user can
                  configure and reconfigure to represent their
                  algorithm in hardware. Whereas a traditional
                  processor can be viewed as a pipeline for processing
                  instructions, an FPGA is a pipeline for processing
                  data. The chief advantage of the FPGA is that all
                  the instructions in the algorithm are already
                  hardwired onto the chip. This means that execution
                  time depends only on the amount of data to be
                  processed, and not on the complexity of the
                  algorithm. The main contribution is an
                  implementation of the well-known Kaczmarz row
                  projection algorithm on the FPGA, using techniques
                  of dataflow programming. This kernel is used as the
                  preconditioning step of CGMN, a modified version of
                  the conjugate gradients method that is used to solve
                  the time-harmonic acoustic isotropic constant
                  density wave equation. Using one FPGA accelerator,
                  the current implementation allows seismic wave
                  simulations to be performed over twice as fast,
                  compared to running on one Intel Xeon E5-2670
                  core. I also discuss the effect of modifications of
                  the algorithm necessitated by the hardware on the
                  convergence properties of CGMN. Finally, a specific
                  plan for future work is set-out in order to fully
                  exploit the accelerator platform, and my work is set
                  in its larger context},

                  cycle skipping if the starting model is
                  inaccurate. We reformulate FWI so that it instead
                  adapts the predicted data to the observed data using
                  Wiener filters, and then iterates to improve the
                  model by forcing the Wiener filters towards zero-lag
                  delta functions. This adaptive FWI scheme is
                  demonstrated on synthetic data where it is shown to
                  be immune to cycle skipping, and is able to invert
                  successfully data for which conventional FWI fails
                  entirely. The new method does not require low
                  frequencies or a highly accurate starting model to
                  be successful. Adaptive FWI has some features in
                  common with wave-equation migration velocity
                  analysis, but it works for all types of arrivals

                  computational burden of full-waveform inversion in
                  the frequency domain. For this task we employ the
                  CARP-CG algorithm (Gordon & Gordon 2010), an
                  iterative solver that preconditions the original
                  Helmholtz system into an equivalent symmetric
                  positive definite system and then applies the method
                  of conjugate gradients. Forming the matrix for the
                  new system is not necessary as its multiplicative
                  action on a vector is implemented using a series of
                  projections onto the rows of the original
                  system. Our contribution is implementing CARP-CG for
                  a host + accelerator (FPGA) computing
                  environment. The computational paradigm is one of
                  dataflow: vector and matrix elements are streamed
                  from memory through the accelerator which applies
                  the row projections. The advantage of an FPGA to
                  process streams of data is that unless the algorithm
                  is memory bandwidth limited, computation time is
                  directly proportional to the amount of data. The
                  complexity of the algorithm implemented on the FPGA
                  is irrelevant since all the operations programmed
                  onto the FPGA happen in the same clock tick. In
                  contrast, on a CPU, more complex algorithms require
                  more clock ticks as the instructions are executed
                  sequentially, or with only a small amount of
                  parallelism. Ongoing work porting the CARP-CG
                  algorithm to the accelerator is presented.},

                  inversion problem was proposed by Demanet and Jugnon
                  recently. Instead of directly fitting the data, they
                  proposed to fit a subset of the data's
                  cross-correlation. It can be verified that if the
                  full cross-correlation is used, then the problem is
                  equivalent to the usual least square problem. The
                  subsampling, which is usually considered to cause
                  instability to the solution, is surprisingly useful

                  structure-restoring optimization. By viewing

                  sampling and full azimuthal coverage to produce
                  higher-resolution images have led to the deployment
                  of multiple source vessels across the survey area. A
                  step ahead from multi-source seismic acquisition is
                  simultaneous or blended acquisition where different
                  source arrays/vessels fire shots at
                  near-simultaneous or slightly random times. Seismic
                  data acquisition with simultaneous (or blended)
                  sources has helped improve acquisition efficiency
                  and mitigate acquisition related costs. Deblending

                  high, which may lead to over fitting the

                  address this issue. Most commonly, people data-
                  filtering operations that are aimed to deemphasize
                  the elastic phases in the data in favor of the

                  soundspeed, from seismic data. A formulation in the
                  frequency-domain leads to an optimization problem
                  constrained by a Helmholtz equation with many
                  right-hand sides. Application of this technique in
                  3D precludes the use of factorization techniques to
                  solve the Helmholtz equation due the large number of
                  gridpoints and the bandwidth of the matrix. While
                  many sophisticated pre-conditioned iterative
                  techniques have been developed for the Helmholtz
                  equation, they often include model-specific tuning
                  parameters and are thus not very attractive for
                  inversion since the medium parameters change from
                  one iteration to the next. In this paper, we propose
                  a method for 3D seismic waveform inversion that
                  addresses both the need to efficiently solve the
                  Helmholtz equation as well as the computational cost
                  induced by the many right-hand sides. To solve the
                  Helmholtz equation, we consider a simple generic
                  preconditioned iterative method (CARP-CG) that is
                  well-suited for inversion because of its
                  robustness. We extend this method to a
                  block-iterative method that can efficiently handle
                  multiple right-hand sides. To reduce the
                  computational cost of of the overall optimization
                  procedure, we use recently proposed techniques from
                  stochastic optimization that allow us to work with
                  approximate gradient information. These
                  approximations are obtained by evaluating only a
                  small portion of the right-hand sides and/or by
                  solving the PDE approximately. We propose heuristics

                  differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization
                  problems that occur in (geophysical) inversion
                  problems. The method takes measured data from a
                  physical system as input and minimizes an objective
                  function that depends on an unknown model for the
                  physical parameters, fields, and additional nuisance
                  parameters such as the source function. The
                  invention consists of a minimization procedure
                  involving a cost functional comprising of a
                  data-misfit term and a penalty term that measures
                  how accurately the fields satisfy the PDE. The

                  the solution of a system of equations forming the
                  discretization of the data-augmented PDE, and the
                  solution of physical model parameters from the PDE
                  itself given the field that solves the

                  PDE-constrained optimization, there is no need to
                  update and store the fields for all sources leading
                  to significant memory savings. As in the all-at-once
                  approach, the proposed method explores a larger
                  search space and is therefore less sensitive to
                  initial estimates for the physical model
                  parameters. Contrary to the reduced formulation, the
                  proposed method does not require the solution of an
                  adjoint PDE, effectively halving the number of PDE
                  solves and memory requirement. As in the reduced
                  formulation, fields can be computed independently
                  and aggregated, possibly in parallel.},

                  manifold of Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensors, an
                  extremely efficient format for representing
                  high-dimensional tensors exhibiting particular
                  low-rank structure. With some minor alterations to
                  existing theoretical developments, we develop an
                  optimization framework based on the geometric
                  understanding of HT tensors as a smooth manifold, a
                  generalization of smooth curves/surfaces. Building
                  on the existing research of solving optimization
                  problems on smooth manifolds, we develop Steepest
                  Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods for HT
                  tensors. The resulting algorithms converge quickly,
                  are immediately parallelizable, and do not require
                  the computation of SVDs. We also derive efficient
                  Gauss-Newton based algorithms which converge much
                  faster than standard, first-order methods. We also
                  extend ideas about favourable sampling conditions
                  for missing-data recovery from the field of Matrix
                  Completion to Tensor Completion and demonstrate how
                  the organization of data can affect the success of
                  recovery. As a result, if one has data with randomly
                  missing source pairs, using these ideas, coupled
                  with an efficient solver, one can interpolate
                  large-scale seismic data volumes with missing
                  sources and/or receivers by exploiting the
                  multidimensional dependencies in the data. We are
                  able to recover data volumes amidst extremely high
                  subsampling ratios (in some cases, > 75\%) using this
                  approach and we demonstrate our recovery on a

  abstract = {Wave-equation based inversions, such as full-waveform
                  inversion, are challenging because of their
                  computational costs, memory requirements, and
                  reliance on accurate initial models. To confront
                  these issues, we propose a novel formulation of
                  full-waveform inversion based on a penalty
                  method. In this formulation, the objective function
                  consists of a data-misfit term and a penalty term
                  which measures how accurately the wavefields satisfy
                  the wave-equation. Because we carry out the
                  inversion over a larger search space, including both
                  the model and synthetic wavefields, our approach
                  suffers less from local minima. Our main
                  contribution is the development of an efficient
                  optimization scheme that avoids having to store and
                  update the wavefields by explicit
                  elimination. Compared to existing optimization
                  strategies for full-waveform inversion, our method
                  differers in two main aspects; i. The wavefields are
                  solved from an augmented wave-equation, where the
                  solution is forced to solve the wave-equation and
                  fit the observed data, ii. no adjoint wavefields are
                  required to update the model, which leads to
                  significant computational savings. We demonstrate
                  the validity of our approach by carefully selected
                  examples and discuss possible extensions and future
                  research. This is joint work with Tristan van

                  geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of
                  as multidimensional correlations of the source and
                  receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing the
                  gathers lies in the fact that one needs to store and
                  compute these wavefields and in correlating the
                  wavefields to obtain the desired image
                  gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically
                  only computed for a limited number of subsurface
                  points and for a limited range of subsurface
                  offsets. In this presentation, we offer a new
                  perspective on such gathers by organizing the
                  extended image as a function of all subsurface
                  offsets for all subsurface points in a matrix whose

                  allowed for new computational approaches in the
                  field of seismic data interpolation.  One of the
                  main requirements of exploiting rank-minimization
                  approaches is that the target data set should
                  exhibit a low-rank structure. Seismic frequency
                  slices exhibit low-rank structure at the
                  low-frequencies, but not at the high
                  frequencies. This behavior is due to the increase in
                  oscillations as we move from low to high-frequency
                  slices, even though the energy remains focused
                  around the diagonal. Therefore, interpolation via
                  rank minimization in the high-frequency range
                  requires extended formulations that incorporate
                  low-rank structure. We propose an approach for
                  seismic data interpolation which incorporates the
                  Hierarchical Semi-Separable Structure (HSS) inside
                  rank-regularized least-squares formulations for the
                  missing-trace interpolation problem. The proposed
                  approach is suitable for large scale problems, since
                  it avoids SVD computations and uses a low-rank
                  factorized formulation instead. We illustrate the
                  advantages of the new HSS approach by interpolating
                  a seismic line from the Gulf of Suez and compare the
                  reconstruction with conventional rank minimization.},

                  interpolation and redatuming algorithms rely on on
                  the assumption that seismic records and images
                  permit sparse approximations under certain
                  representations, such as Curvelet
                  coefficients. Recent findings have suggested that
                  for redundant representations (of which Curvelet is
                  an example), the analysis operator that maps the
                  physical signal to coefficients may also play a
                  crucial role in recovering data from incomplete
                  observations. This insight elevates the significance
                  of a question that often goes unaddressed: is it
                  better for the transform-domain sparsity to be
                  achieved through explicit construction of sparse
                  representations (e.g., by thresholding of small
                  transform-domain coefficients), or by demanding that
                  the algorithm return physical signals which produces
                  sparse coefficients when hit with the forward
                  transform? Recent results show that the two
                  approaches give rise to different solutions when the
                  transform is redundant, and that the latter approach
                  imposes a whole new class of constraints. In
                  particular, the number of zero-valued coefficients
                  given by the analysis operator acting on the signal,

                  role to the sparsity of the signal in terms of the
                  coefficients. From this framework, a new
                  reconstruction algorithm is proposed which may allow
                  better reconstruction from subsampled signaled than
                  what the sparsity assumption alone would predict. In
                  this work we apply the new framework and algorithm
                  to the case of seismic data interpolation under the
                  curvelet domain, and show that it admits better
                  reconstruction than some existing L1 sparsity-based
                  methods derived from compressive sensing for a range
                  of subsampling factors. We will also investigate
                  different analysis operators and their impact on
                  both sparsity and cosparsity-based algorithms.},

  year = {2012},
  organization = {SINBAD},
  abstract = {Seismic surveys amass large and incomplete data
                  sets, and designing algorithms to interpolate the
                  missing data at very large scales poses a daunting
                  and critical challenge.  We study how to apply
                  scalable matrix completion methods to such
                  interpolation problems.  Recent studies in matrix
                  completion have shown that a matrix that has low
                  rank can be exactly completed when only a small
                  number of observations are available. However, there
                  are two challenges to applying matrix completion to
                  seismic data. Matrix completion is typically applied
                  to two dimensional or dyadic data whereas seismic
                  data is often tensorial. Also successful matrix
                  completion requires a low-rank matrix structure. We
                  address these problems by organizing the seismic
                  data on a matrix grid which exhibits a low-rank
                  structure. This encoding allows us to apply the
                  Jellyfish algorithm, developed at the University of
                  Wisconsin, which achieves state-of-the-art
                  performance for large-scale matrix completion. The
                  proposed framework makes it possible to complete
                  high-SNR interpolations of gigabytes of 4-D seismic
                  data in minutes on standard multicore
                  workstations. Our preliminary experimental results
                  suggest that matrix completion provides a promising

                  (rank, the SVD, linear systems, etc.) to higher
                  dimensional arrays, or tensors. Much work has been
                  proposed to try to overcome the so called "curse of
                  dimensionality", the O(N^d) storage required for a
                  d-dimensional array, where N is the size of each
                  dimension. The hierarchical Tucker format is one
                  such tensor representation which manages to
                  decompose a hierarchy of dimensions into parameter
                  matrices of very manageable size, requiring at most
                  dNK + (d - 2)K^3 + K^2 parameters, where K is an

                  sophisticated algorithms that require multiple paths
                  through all data. This requirement leads to problems
                  because the size of seismic data volumes is
                  increasing exponentially, exposing bottlenecks in IO
                  and computational capability. To overcome these

                  to the Helmholtz equation is CARP-CG. CARP-CG uses
                  Kaczmarz row projections for each block of a domain
                  decomposition scheme to precondition the Helmholtz
                  system into being symmetric and positive
                  semidefinite. The method of conjugate gradients is
                  then used to solve the preconditioned system. We
                  present a comparison of the performance of CARP-CG
                  implemented in several languages (MATLAB, C,
                  FORTRAN, julia) and in two different hardware
                  environments: the LIMA HPC cluster hosted at UBC,
                  and the Checkers cluster which is part of the
                  Westgrid consortium. Parallelization of the
                  algorithm via domain decomposition implemented with
                  MPI (distributed memory) and OMP (shared memory) is
                  also examined.},

  abstract = {Many inverse problems include nuisance parameters. While
                  not of direct interest, these parameters are
                  required to recover primary parameters. In order to
                  estimate these nuisance parameters as well as the
                  primary parameters in large-scale inverse problems,
                  a method based on variable projection, which
                  consists in projecting out a subset over the
                  variables, has been developed. We present here the
                  application of this method to the problem of
                  variance parameters estimation in multiple datasets,
                  which is an important problem in many areas
                  including geophysics. More precisely, we apply the
                  method to Full Waveform Inversion and demonstrate
                  the improvement in recovery of the model parameters
                  in the case where the variance of the noise
                  increases with the frequency.},

  title = {Anisotropic {3D} full-waveform inversion of the {Tommeliten} {Alpha} field},
  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},
  year = {2012},
  organization = {SINBAD},
  abstract = {We have implemented a robust and practical scheme for
                  anisotropic 3D acoustic full-waveform inversion. We
                  demonstrate this scheme on a field data set,
                  applying it to a four-component ocean-bottom survey
                  over the Tommeliten Alpha field in the North
                  Sea. This shallow-water data set provides good
                  azimuthal coverage to offsets of 7 km, with reduced
                  coverage to a maximum offset of about 11 km. The
                  reservoir lies at the crest of a high-velocity
                  antiformal chalk section, overlain by about 3000 m
                  of clastics within which a low-velocity gas cloud
                  produces a seismic obscured area. We inverted only
                  the hydrophone data, and we retained free-surface
                  multiples and ghosts within the field data. We
                  invert in six narrow frequency bands, in the range 3
                  to 6.5 Hz. At each iteration, we selected only a
                  subset of sources, using a different subset at each
                  iteration; this strategy is more efficient than
                  inverting all the data every iteration. Our starting
                  velocity model was obtained using standard PSDM
                  model building including anisotropic reflection
                  tomography, and contained epsilon values as high as
                  20\%. We have also attempted full-elastic inversion
                  of these data to recover a shallow isotropic model
                  of both p and s-wave velocities. The final FWI
                  velocity model shows a network of shallow
                  high-velocity channels that match similar features
                  in the reflection data. Deeper in the section, the
                  FWI velocity model reveals a sharper and
                  more-intense low-velocity region associated with the
                  gas cloud in which low-velocity fingers match the
                  location of gas-filled faults visible in the
                  reflection data. The resulting velocity model
                  provides a better match to well logs, and better
                  flattens common image gathers, than does the
                  starting model. Reverse-time migration, using the
                  FWI velocity model, provides significant uplift to
                  the migrated image, simplifying the planform of the
                  reservoir section at depth. The workflows, inversion
                  strategy, and algorithms that we have used have
                  broad application to invert a wide-range of
                  analogous field data sets.},

  title = {Fast {Gauss-Newton} full-waveform inversion with sparsity regularization},
  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},
  year = {2012},
  organization = {SINBAD},
  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) can be considered as a
                  controlled data fitting process, in which we
                  approximately fit observed data by iteratively
                  updating the initial velocity model, we expect the
                  final model can reveal subsurface structure till the
                  wavefield misfit can converge to designed tolerance.
                  The conventional FWI approach is expensive since it
                  requires the inversion of a linear system, which
                  involves extremely large multi-experiment data
                  volumes. To overcome this issue we percent a
                  curvetlet based sparsity-promoting Gauss-Newton
                  inversion method. In this presentation we invert for
                  the model updates by replacing the normal
                  Gauss-Newton linearized subproblem for subsampled
                  FWI with a sparsity promoting FWI formulation. We
                  speed up the algorithm and avoid over fitting the
                  data by solving the problem approximately. Aside
                  from this, we control wavefield dispersion by
                  gradually increasing grid size as we move to higher
                  frequencies. Our approach is successful because it
                  reduces the size of seismic data volumes without
                  loss of information. With this reduction, we can
                  compute a Newton-like update with the reduced data
                  volume at the cost of roughly one gradient update
                  for the fully sampled wavefield.},

                  "weighted" algorithms to recover sparse signals from
                  few linear, non-adaptive measurements. The general
                  principle here is to use prior knowledge about the
                  signal to be recovered, e.g., approximate locations
                  of large-in-magnitude transform coefficients, if
                  such information is available. An example for this
                  is the use of weighted 1-norm minimization to
                  improve wavefield reconstruction from randomized
                  (sub)sampling. We will review these results and
                  outline some new directions we have explored during
                  the last year, such as weighted non-convex sparse
                  recovery (see Ghadermarzy's talk), weighted
                  analysis-based recovery (see Hargreaves's talk), and
                  a weighted randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for solving
                  large overdetermined systems of equations that are
                  known to admit a (nearly) sparse solution. Various
