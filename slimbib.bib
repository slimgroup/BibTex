  title = {Seismic waveform inversion using decomposed one-way wavefields},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Conventional seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) estimates a velocity model by matching the two-way predicted data with the observed data. The non-linearity of the problem and the complexity of the Earth's subsurface, which results in complex wave propagation may lead to unsatisfactory inversion results. Moreover, having inaccurate overburden models, i.e water velocity model in the ocean bottom acquisition setting, may lead to erroneous velocity models. In order to obtain better velocity models, we simplify the FWI problem by decomposing the total two-way observed and predicted wavefields into one-way wavefields at the receiver locations using acoustic wavefield decomposition. We then propose to fit the less-complex one-way wavefield to obtain a velocity model that contains valuable information about the overburden. We use this inverted velocity model as a better initial model for the inversion using the other more-complex one-way wavefield. We demonstrate our proposed algorithm on acoustic non-inverse crime synthetic data produced from the Marmousi2 model. The proposed method provides improved inversion results compared with conventional FWI due to properly accounting for separate model updates from the up- and down-going wavefields.},

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a non-linear procedure to es- timate subsurface rock parameters from surface measurements of induced seismic waves. This procedure is ill-posed in nature and hence, requires regularization to enhance some structure depending on the prior information. Recently, Total-variation (TV) regularization has gained popularity due to its ability to produce blocky structures. Contrary to this, the earth behave more like a piecewise smooth function. TV regularization fails to enforce this prior information into FWI. We propose a Mumford-Shah functional to incorporate the piecewise smooth spatial structure in the FWI procedure. The resulting opti- mization problem is solved by a splitting method. We show the improvement in results against TV regularization on two synthetic camembert examples.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a cost-effective low-rank factorized form of computing the full subsurface extended image volumes without explicitly calculating the receiver wavefields.  The propose approach is computationally feasible, which exploits the low-rank structure of full subsurface extended image volumes organized as a matrix, thus avoiding the customary loop over sources.  Using carefully selected stylized examples, we show how conventional migration images can be extracted from the low-rank factorized form. We also present a velocity continuation procedure that uses the same low-rank form and allows us to map the extended image for one velocity model to another velocity model without recomputing all the source wavefields.},

  abstract = {In order to obtain accurate images of the subsurface, anisotropic modeling and imaging is necessary. However, the twenty-one parameter complete wave-equation is too computationally expensive to be of use in this case. The transverse tilted isotropic wave-equation is then the next best feasible representation of the physics to use for imaging. The main complexity arising from transverse tilted isotropic imaging is to model the receiver wavefield (back propagation of the data or data residual) for the imaging condition. Unlike the isotropic or the full physics wave-equations, the transverse tilted isotropic wave-equation is not not self-adjoint. This difference means that time-reversal will not model the correct receiver wavefield and this can lead to incorrect subsurface images. In this work, we derive and implement the adjoint wave-equation to demonstrate the necessity of exact adjoint modeling for anisotropic modeling and compare our result with adjoint-free time-reversed imaging.},

  abstract = {Microseismic data is often used to locate fracture locations and their origin in time created by fracking. Although surface microseismic data can have large apertures and is easier to acquire than the borehole data, it often suffers from poor signal to noise ratio (S/R). Poor S/R poses a challenge in terms of estimating the correct location and source-time function of a microseismic source. In this work, we propose a denoising step in combination with a computationally cheap debiasing based approach to locate microseismic sources and to estimate their source-time functions with correct amplitude from extremely noisy data. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method can work with closely spaced microseismic sources with source-time functions of different peak amplitudes and frequencies. We have also shown the ability of our method with the smooth velocity model.},

While these developments are certainly important, we are after all dealing with an imaging problem involving an unknown earth and not completely understood physics. When the imaging step itself is not handled properly, this may possibly offset gains offered by deep learning. Motivated by our work on deep convolutional neural networks in seismic data reconstruction, we discuss how generative networks can be employed in prestack problems ranging from the relatively mondane removal of the effects of the free surface to dealing with the complex effects of numerical dispersion in time-domain finite differences. While the results we present are preliminary, there are strong indications that generative deep convolutional neural networks can have a major impact on complex tasks in prestack seismic data processing and modeling for inversion.},

The strong density perturbation will be inverted as strong dummy velocity perturbations, which influence the amplitudes and phase of the velocity perturbations in the inverted model. The traditional method is to invert the additional density variations by developing Born operator with respect to both density and velocity or modify the image condition. In this work, we develop a matched-filter based LS-RTM for velocity-only Born modeling operator, which removes the artifacts in the imaging created by the strong density variation. This method doesn't call for extra work of finite difference stencil and is more general. In the experiment part, we use a complex discontinuous layered medium with strong density variations at the ocean bottom, and show the efficacy of the propose formulation.},

  abstract = {Seismic data, mainly on land, suffers from long-wavelength statics
due to the laterally varying and heterogeneous nature of the near-surface
weathering layers. We propose an automatic, data-driven and computationally efficient
statics correction method based on low-rank approximation to correct for such
statics. The method does not require a model to estimate static time shifts,
which is the case for other static correction methods; rather it applies the
appropriate static corrections on the data such that it becomes low rank in a
certain domain. As of now, the method is applicable to data that has been
corrected for elevation statics. Due to the near-surface irregularities and
due to approximations used by static correction methods that lead to not fully
correcting for statics, an iterative residual statics correction becomes
necessary. Our proposed method corrects for residual statics without the
necessity of the surface consistency assumption and a multi-iterate process.
Additional benefits of the method include artifacts and noise suppression. We
demonstrate the successful application of our method on several synthetic
data examples.},

shooting the full sequence of encoded sweeps on each shot point to
reconstruct the complete frequency bandwidth Green's function. Although this simultaneous

shooting, the gain in efficiency is limited. To further reduce the sweeping time, we
propose to acquire randomly selected subsets of the encoded sweeps sequences

Compressed Sensing has provided theoretical foundations upon which desired sampling rate can be achieved by applying a sparsity promoting algorithm on sub-sampled data. The key point in successful recovery is to deploy a randomized sampling scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for fast and accurate reconstruction of heavily under-sampled seismic data, regardless of type of sampling. A neural network learns to do reconstruction directly from data via an adversarial process. Once trained, the reconstruction can be done by just feeding the frequency slice with missing data into the neural network. This adaptive nonlinear model makes the algorithm extremely flexible, applicable to data with arbitrarily type of sampling. With the assumption that we have access to training data, the quality of reconstructed slice is superior even for extremely low sampling rate (as low as 10%) due to the data-driven nature of the method.},

  pages = {2533-2538},
  abstract = {Spatial Nyquist sampling rate, which is proportional to
                  the apparent subsurface velocity, is the key
                  deciding cost factor for conventional seismic
                  acquisition. Due to the lower shear wave velocity
                  compared with compressional waves, finer spatial
                  sampling is required to properly record the earlier,
                  which increases the acquisition costs. This is one
                  of the reasons why shear waves are usually not
                  considered in practice. To avoid having the Nyquist
                  criterion as the deciding cost factor and to utilize
                  multicomponent data to its available full extent, we
                  propose acquiring randomly undersampled ocean bottom
                  seismic data. Each component can then be
                  interpolated separately, followed by elastic
                  decomposition to recover up- and down-going
                  S-waves. Instead, we jointly interpolate and
                  decompose the recorded multicomponent data by
                  solving one sparsity promoting optimization
                  problem. This way we ensure that the relative
                  amplitudes of the multicomponent data is
                  preserved. We compare two sparsifying transforms:
                  the curvelet transform and the frequency-wavenumber
                  transform. Another key cost deciding factor for
                  seismic acquisition is the efficiency of acquiring
                  data. This calls for simultaneous acquisition, which
                  requires a source separation step. Similarly,
                  instead of taking a two-step approach, we perform a
                  sparsity-promoting joint source separation
                  decomposition. Results on economically and
                  efficiently acquired synthetic data of both joint
                  methods show their ability of reconstructing

                  of least-squares reverse-time migration (LS-RTM) of
                  primaries. In Marine data however, these
                  applications rely on the success of a pre-imaging
                  separation of primaries and multiples, which can be
                  modeled as a multi-dimensional convolution between
                  the vertical derivative of the surface-free Green’s
                  function and the down-going receiver
                  wavefield. Instead of imaging the primaries and
                  multiples separately, we implement the LS-RTM of the
                  total down-going wavefield by combining areal source
                  injection and linearized Born modelling, where
                  strong surface related multiples are generated from
                  a strong density variation at the ocean bottom. The
                  advantage including surface related multiples in
                  LS-RTM is the extra illumination we obtain from
                  these multiples without incurring additional
                  computational costs related to carrying out
                  multi-dimensional convolutions part of conventional
                  multiple prediction procedures. Even though we are
                  able to avert these computational costs, our
                  approach shares the large costs of LSRTM. We reduce
                  these costs by combining randomized source
                  subsampling with our sparsity-promoting imaging
                  technology, which produces artifact-free,
                  high-resolution images, with the surface-related
                  multiples migrated properly.},

This relation leads to the methods that separate the surface-related multiples and primaries. Instead of imaging separated multiples trivially, we introduced the SRME relation into wave equation by areal source injection, which costs nothing extra to involve multiples into the forward wavefields. The related image contains the phantoms components from cross-correlation between different-orders of events. Especially in shallow water, due to the strong magnitudes of multiples and their overlap with primaries, the artifacts contain strong phantoms not only of ocean bottom but also subsurface layer interfaces. We use sparsity-promoting inversions where the nicely curved structure of the subsurface models are detected to help cleaning up the phantoms. We reduce the costs by combin- ing randomized source subsampling with linearized Bregman method and get cleaned image with one data pass.},

                  of complex geology such as fault belts and sub-salt
                  areas, is an increasingly expensive and risky
                  endeavour. Typically long-offset and dense sampling
                  seismic data are required for subsequent shot based
                  processing procedures, e.g. wave-equation based
                  inversion (WEI) and surface-related multiple
                  elimination (SRME). However, these strict
                  requirements result in an exponential growth in data
                  volume size and prohibitive demands on computational
                  resources, given the multidimensional nature of the
                  data volumes. Moreover the physical constraints and
                  cost limitations impose restrictions on acquiring
                  fully sampled data. In this work, we propose to
                  invert our large-scale data from a set of subsampled
                  measurements, resulting in an estimate of the true
                  volume in a compressed low-rank tensor
                  format. Rather than expanding the data to its
                  fully-sampled form for later downstream processes,
                  we demonstrate how to use this compressed data
                  directly via on-the-fly common shot or receiver
                  gathers extraction. The combination of massive
                  compression and fast on demand data reconstruction
                  of 3D shot or receiver gathers leads to a
                  substantial reduction in memory costs but with
                  minimal effects on results in the subsequent
                  processing procedures. We demonstrate the effective
                  implementation of our proposed framework on
                  full-waveform inversion on a 3D seismic synthetic
                  data set generated from a Overthrust model.},

                  record the shear waves. This leads to higher
                  acquisition costs which are typically avoided by
                  designing surveys geared towards only compressional
                  waves imaging. We propose using randomly

  abstract = {Many inverse problems in applied science and engineering
                  can be written as PDE-constrained optimization
                  problems. Typically, one is interested in estimating
                  the unknown medium parameters of the PDE describing
                  the system, given multi-source measurements of the
                  fields in the true medium. The objective function is
                  often very oscillatory, which gives rise to
                  problematic local minima, and merely evaluating one
                  or more of its derivatives requires solving multiple
                  PDEs, which are expensive. In many applications such
                  as seismic exploration, only the source location is
                  available and the source signature itself is
                  unknown, which results in erroneous estimated
                  parameters. In this work, we propose a penalty
                  method to solve the PDE-constrained optimization
                  problem, whereby we replace the PDE constraints by a
                  two-norm penalty term, which leads to a bi-linear
                  optimization problem with a much less oscillatory
                  objective function. By applying the variable
                  projection method, we develop an efficient method to
                  invert the unknown parameters and source signatures
                  simultaneously. To reduce the computational cost, we
                  randomly select a subset of all data to update the
                  parameters at each iteration. Numerical examples
                  demonstrate that this method is less prone to
                  becoming stuck in harmful local minima and is able
                  to successfully invert the unknown parameters and
                  source signature with less computational cost
                  compared to using all the data.},

                  subsequent processing (e.g. EPSI) and
                  migration. However, the removal of cross-flow noise
                  is a challenging process because cross-flow noise
                  dominates steep angles and low-frequency components

  abstract = {Recently, new ideas on randomized sampling for
                  time-lapse seismic acquisition have been proposed to
                  address some of the challenges of replicating
                  time-lapse surveys. These ideas, which stem from
                  distributed compressed sensing (DCS) led to the
                  birth of a joint recovery model (JRM) for processing
                  time-lapse data (noise-free) acquired from
                  non-replicated acquisition geometries. However, when
                  the earth does not change---i.e. no time-lapse—the
                  recovered vintages from two non-replicated surveys
                  should show high repeatability measured in terms of
                  normalized RMS, which is a standard metric for
                  quantifying time-lapse data repeatability. Under

  abstract = {Reverse-time migration (RTM) with the conventional
                  cross-correlation imaging condition suffers from
                  low-frequency artifacts that result from
                  backscattered energy in the background velocity
                  models. This problem translates to least-squares
                  reverse-time migration (LS-RTM), where these
                  artifacts slow down the convergence, as many of the
                  initial iterations are spent on removing them. In
                  RTM, this problem has been successfully addressed by
                  the introduction of the so-called inverse scattering
                  imaging condition, which naturally removes these
                  artifacts. In this work, we derive the corresponding
                  linearized forward operator of the inverse
                  scattering imaging operator and incorporate this
                  forward/adjoint operator pair into a
                  sparsity-promoting (SPLS-RTM) workflow. We
                  demonstrate on a challenging salt model, that LS-RTM
                  with the inverse scattering imaging condition is far
                  less prone to low-frequency artifacts than the
                  conventional cross-correlation imaging condition,
                  improves the convergence and does not require any
                  type of additional image filters within the
                  inversion. Through source subsampling and sparsity
                  promotion, we reduce the computational cost in terms
                  of PDE solves to a number comparable to conventional

                  level. Such sampling schemes typically involve
                  running multiple inversions or evaluating the
                  Hessian of the cost function, both of which are
                  computationally expensive. In this work, we propose
                  a new method to quantify uncertainties based on a
                  novel formulation of the full-waveform inversion
                  problem – wavefield reconstruction inversion. Based
                  on this formulation, we formulate a semidefinite
                  approximation of the corresponding Hessian
                  matrix. By precomputing certain quantities, we are
                  able to apply this Hessian to given input vectors
                  without additional solutions of the underlying
                  partial differential equations. To generate a
                  sample, we solve an auxiliary stochastic
                  optimization problem involving this Hessian. The
                  result is a computationally feasible method that,
                  with little overhead, can generate as many samples
                  as required at small additional cost. We test our
                  method on the synthetic BG Compass model and compare
                  the results to a direct-sampling approach. The
                  results show the feasibility of applying our method
                  to computing statistical quantities such as the mean
                  and standard deviation in the context of wavefield
                  reconstruction inversion.},

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion is arguably one of the most
                  challenging inverse problems out there. For this
                  reason, it is remarkable that so much progress has
                  been made over the years. While we can look back
                  with confidence at an increasing number of success
                  stories, the application of full-waveform
                  technologies to deeper targets and complex geologies
                  remains challenging making it an expensive
                  proposition. So far, efforts to overcome some of
                  these challenges have mainly been directed towards
                  extended formulations such as Symes's and Biondi's
                  subsurface offset/rau-parameters, Mike Warner/Lluis
                  Guasch's Wiener filters in their adaptive
                  full-waveform inversion, and van Leeuwen/Herrmann's
                  Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion, where the
                  wave-equation appears as a least-squares term in the
                  objective. While this recent work --- including
                  other approaches such as different data-misfit
                  objective functions --- has removed some of FWI
                  cycle-skip issues it does, with the exception
                  perhaps of box constraints, not incorporate
                  rudimentary information on the geology on the
                  unknown model. Following recent work by Ernie Esser,
                  we present a general framework how to incorporate
                  this type of information in the form of
                  constraints. Contrary to Tikhonov-like
                  regularization or gradient filtering, imposing
                  constraints has several key advantages, namely (i)
                  they can be expressed in simple human understandable
                  terms such as lower and upper limits for the
                  velocity without the necessity to introduce
                  additional parameters and assumptions on the
                  probability distribution of the model; (ii) they can
                  consist of several constraints, e.g. box and
                  smoothness constraints, as long as their
                  intersection in non-empty; and (iii) they can be
                  imposed in a separate inner loop, which does not
                  affect gradients and Hessians of full-waveform
                  inversion itself. By means of examples, we will
                  demonstrate the advocacy of constrained formulations
                  as they apply to full-waveform inversion. This is

                  single- (or multiple-) source vessel fires at
                  jittered source locations and time
                  instances. Consequently, the acquired simultaneous
                  data volume is processed to separate the overlapping
                  shot records resulting in densely sampled data
                  volume. It has been shown in the past that the
                  simultaneous source acquisition design and source
                  separation process can be setup as a compressed
                  sensing problem, where conventional seismic data is
                  reconstructed from simultaneous data via a
                  sparsity-promoting optimization formulation. While
                  the recovery quality of separated data is reasonably

                  least-squares problem where the gradient is computed
                  using the adjoint-state algorithm. This formulation
                  offers parallelism for the computation of gradients
                  for different sources and frequencies. The
                  adjoint-state algorithm itself is sequential however
                  and this is a limiting factor when a lot of compute
                  nodes are available and only a few wavefields need
                  to be computed. This situation occurs when
                  stochastic optimization strategies are used to
                  minimize the objective function. We present a
                  parallel reformulation of the sequential

                  and adjoint wavefields to be computed in

                  equivalent but the parallel version is twice as fast

                  proposed algorithm is that one wavefield needs to be
                  computed per source and one per receiver. These

                  Gauss-Newton Hessian to a vector without recomputing
                  wavefields. A 2D example shows that good

                  approximating the exact pure Pwave dispersion
                  relation. In this work, we present an alternative
                  approach to the approximate dispersion relation of
                  Etgen and Brandsberg-Dahl, in which we approximate
                  the exact dispersion relation through a polynomial
                  expansion and determine its coefficients by solving
                  a linear least squares problem that minimizes the
                  phase velocity error over the entire range of phase
                  angles. The coefficients are also optimized over a
                  pre-defined range of Thomsen parameters, so that the
                  phase error is small for models with spatially
                  varying anisotropy. Phase velocity error analysis
                  shows that the optimized pure P-wave equation is up
                  to one order of magnitude more accurate than other
                  popular pure P-wave equations, even for highly
                  non-elliptic anisotropy. The optimized equation can
                  be easily turned into a time-domain forward modeling
                  scheme and comparisons of the modeled waveforms with
                  analytical travel times once more illustrate its
                  high accuracy. We also provide an efficient
                  implementation of our approach for 3D tilted TI
                  media that limits the count of fast Fourier
                  transforms per time step to a number that is
                  comparable to other pure P-wave equations.},

                  with wrong amplitudes and low
                  resolution. Least-squares RTM (LS-RTM) on the other
                  hand, is capable of obtaining true-amplitude images
                  as solutions of $\ell_2$-norm norm minimization
                  problems by fitting the synthetic and observed
                  reflection data. The shortcoming of this approach is
                  that solutions of these $\ell_2$ problems are
                  typically smoothed, tend to be overfitted, and
                  computationally too expensive because it requires
                  compared to standard RTM too many iterations. By
                  working with randomized subsets of data only, the
                  computational costs of LS-RTM can be brought down to
                  an acceptable level while producing artifact-free
                  high-resolution images without overfitting the
                  data. While initial results of these "compressive
                  imaging" methods were encouraging various open
                  issues remain including guaranteed convergence,
                  algorithmic complexity of the solver, and lack of
                  on-the-fly source estimation for LS-RTMs with
                  wave-equation solvers based on time-stepping. By
                  including on-the-fly source-time function estimation
                  into the method of Linearized Bregman (LB), on which
                  we reported before, we tackle all these issues
                  resulting in a easy-to-implement algorithm that
                  offers flexibility in the trade-off between the
                  number of iterations and the number of wave-equation
                  solves per iteration for a fixed total number of
                  wave-equation solves. Application of our algorithm
                  on a 2D synthetic shows that we are able to obtain
                  high-resolution images, including accurate estimates
                  of the wavelet, for a single pass through the
                  data. The produced image, which is by virtue of the
                  inversion deconvolved with respect to the wavelet,
                  is roughly of the same quality as the image obtained
                  given the correct source function.},

                  sampling theory. The unpredictable movement of the
                  ocean`s currents can be detrimental in acquiring
                  exactly equally-spaced samples while sampling at

                  numerical challenges compared to matrix
                  completion. Here we consider a tensor completion

                  model, which includes surface related multiples.
                  Minimizing the ratio of $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms
                  has been previously shown to promote sparsity in a
                  variety of applications including blind
                  deconvolution. Most existing implementations are
                  heuristic or require smoothing the $\ell_1/\ell_2$
                  penalty. Lifted versions of $\ell_1/\ell_2$
                  constraints have also been proposed but are
                  challenging to implement. Inspired by the lifting
                  approach, we propose to split the sparse signals

                  techniques has been recently introduced in the

                  rank-minimization techniques assume the recording
                  locations to be on a regular grid, e.g., sampled
                  periodically, but seismic data are typically
                  irregularly sampled along spatial axes. Other than
                  the irregularity of the sampled grid, we often have

  abstract = {Common image gathers are used in building velocity
                  models, inverting anisotropy parameters, and
                  analyzing reservoir attributes. Often primary
                  reflections are used to form image gathers and
                  multiples are typically attenuated in processing to
                  remove strong coherent artifacts generated by
                  multiples that interfere with the imaged
                  reflectors. However, researchers have shown that, if
                  correctly used, multiples can actually provide extra
                  illumination of the subsurface in seismic imaging,
                  especially for delineating the near-surface
                  features. In this work, we borrow ideas from

                  multiples, and apply these ideas to extended
                  imaging. This way we save the massive computation

                  using them during the formation of image
                  gathers. Also, we mitigate the strong coherent
                  artifacts generated by multiples which can send the
                  migration velocity analysis type algorithms in wrong
                  direction. Synthetic examples on a three-layer model

  abstract = {A framework is proposed for regularizing the waveform
                  inversion problem by projections onto intersections
                  of convex sets. Multiple pieces of prior information
                  about the geology are represented by multiple convex
                  sets, for example limits on the velocity or minimum
                  smoothness conditions on the model. The data-misfit
                  is then minimized, such that the estimated model is
                  always in the intersection of the convex
                  sets. Therefore, it is clear what properties the
                  estimated model will have at each iteration. This
                  approach does not require any quadratic penalties to
                  be used and thus avoids the known problems and
                  limitations of those types of penalties. It is shown
                  that by formulating waveform inversion as a
                  constrained problem, regularization ideas such as
                  Tikhonov regularization and gradient filtering can
                  be incorporated into one framework. The algorithm is
                  generally applicable, in the sense that it works
                  with any (differentiable) objective function and
                  does not require significant additional
                  computation. The method is demonstrated on the
                  inversion of the 2D marine isotropic elastic
                  synthetic seismic benchmark by Chevron using an
                  acoustic modeling code. To highlight the effect of
                  the projections, we apply no data

                  adjoint-state method. However, this method requires
                  access to the forward and adjoint wavefields that
                  are meet when computing gradient updates. The
                  challenge here is that the adjoint wavefield is
                  computed in reverse order during time stepping and
                  therefore requires storage or other type of
                  mitigation because storing the full time history of
                  the forward wavefield is too expensive in realistic
                  3D settings. To overcome this challenge, we propose
                  an approximate adjoint-state method where the
                  wavefields are subsampled randomly, which
                  drastically the amount of storage needed. By using
                  techniques from stochastic optimization, we control
                  the errors induced by the subsampling. Examples of
                  the proposed technique on a synthetic but realistic
                  2D model show that the subsampling-related artifacts
                  can be reduced significantly by changing the
                  sampling for each source after each model
                  update. Combination of this gradient approximation
                  with a quasi-Newton method shows virtually artifact
                  free inversion results requiring only 5% of storage
                  compared to saving the history at Nyquist. In
                  addition, we avoid having to recompute the
                  wavefields as is required by checkpointing.},

                  data. The case study comes from the Permian Basin in
                  Texas, USA. This dataset motivates and tests several
                  new developments in methodology that enable recovery
                  of model results that sit within multiple a priori
                  constraint sets. These constraints are imposed
                  through a Projected Quasi-Newton (PQN) approach,
                  wherein the projection set is the intersection of
                  physical property bounds and anisotropic wavenumber
                  filtering. This enables the method to recover
                  geologically-reasonable models while preserving the
                  fast model convergence offered by a quasi-Newton
                  optimization scheme like l-BFGS. In the Permian
                  Basin example, low-frequency data from both arrays

                  tradeoff parameters as in a quadratic penalty
                  approach to regularization. Multiple 2D FWI results
                  are combined to produce an interpolated 3D model

  abstract = {In the well-known SRME relation, multiples are expressed
                  as the multi-dimensional convolution between the
                  subsurface Green’s function and the downgoing
                  receiver wavefield. Therefore these multiples can be
                  considered as the response of the subsurface to an
                  "areal" source term given by the same downgoing
                  receiver wavefield. This relation can be used to
                  treat these multiples as signals instead of
                  considering them as noise that must removed before
                  seismic imaging. However, when we use conventional
                  reverse-time migration to image these multiple
                  events, it results in acausal imaging artifacts
                  caused by cross-correlations between wrong pairs of
                  up- and downgoing wavefields. We find that these
                  artifacts can be removed by adopting a
                  sparsity-promoting least-squares inversion
                  approach. However, iterative inversions go at the
                  expense of excessive computational costs. By
                  combining the SRME relation and wave-equation based
                  linearized modelling, we are able to significantly
                  reduce the costs by avoiding the dense matrix-matrix
                  multiplications of SRME and the number of
                  wave-equation solves via source subsampling. As a
                  result, we arrive at a method with a cost comparable

                  processing algorithms that attempt to address some
                  of the current 4D challenges, in particular, imaging
                  weak 4D signals. Recent developments from the field
                  of compressive sensing have shown the benefits of
                  variants of randomized sampling in marine seismic
                  acquisition and its impact for the future of seismic
                  exploration. Following these developments, we show
                  that the requirement for accurate survey repetition
                  in time-lapse seismic data acquisition can be waived
                  provided we solve a sparsity-promoting convex
                  optimization program that makes use of the shared
                  component between the baseline and monitor data. By
                  setting up a framework for inversion of the stacked
                  sections of a time-lapse data, given the pre-stack
                  data volumes, we are able to extract 4D signals with
                  relatively highfidelity from significant
                  subsamplings. Our formulation is applied to
                  time-lapse data that has been acquired with
                  different source/receiver geometries, paving the way
                  for an efficient approach to dealing with time-lapse
                  data acquired with initially poor repeatability
                  levels, provided the survey geometry details are
                  known afterwards.},

                  computationally intensive step is the computation of
                  a numerical solution for the wave equation on every
                  iteration. In the frequency domain approach, this
                  requires the solution of very large, complex,
                  sparse, ill-conditioned linear systems. In this
                  extended abstract we bring out attention
                  specifically to CGMN method for solving PDEs, known
                  for being flexible (i.e. it is able to treat equally

                  complex scenarios) efficient with respect both to

                  involves the minimization of a data-misfit and exact
                  solutions of the wave-equation for the current
                  velocity model, the penalty-method aims to first
                  find a wavefield that jointly fits the data and
                  honours the physics, in a least-squares sense. Given
                  this reconstructed wavefield, which is a proxy for
                  the true wavefield in the true model, we calculate
                  updates for the velocity model. Aside from being
                  less nonlinear–the acoustic wave equation is linear
                  in the wavefield and model parameters but not in
                  both–the inversion is carried out over a solution

                  representing high-dimensional tensors exhibit- ing
                  low-rank structure, to handle subsampled tensors
                  with noisy entries. We consider a "low-noise" case,
                  so that the energies of the noise and the signal are
                  nearly indistinguishable, and a ’high-noise’ case,
                  in which the noise energy is now scaled to the
                  amplitude of the entire data volume. We examine the
                  effect of the noise in terms of the singular values
                  along different matricizations of the data, i.e.,
                  reshaping of the tensor along different modes. By
                  interpreting this effect in the context of tensor

                  only a marginal increase in computational cost. We

  abstract = {A classical strategy for blind seismic deconvolution is
                  to first estimate the autocorrelation of the unknown
                  source wavelet from the data and then recover the
                  wavelet by assuming it has minimum phase. However,
                  computing the minimum phase wavelet directly from
                  the amplitude spectrum can be sensitive to even
                  extremely small errors, especially in the
                  coefficients close to zero. Since the minimum phase
                  requirement follows from an assumption that the
                  wavelet should be as impulsive as possible, we
                  propose to directly estimate an impulsive wavelet by
                  minimizing a weighted l2 penalty subject to a
                  constraint on its amplitude spectrum. This nonconvex
                  model has the form of a phase retrieval problem, in
                  this case recovering a signal given only estimates
                  of the magnitudes of its Fourier
                  coefficients. Following recent work on convex
                  relaxations of phase retrieval problems, we propose
                  a convex semidefinite program for computing an
                  impulsive minimum phase wavelet whose amplitude
                  spectrum is close to a given estimate, and we show
                  that this can be robustly solved by a Douglas
                  Rachford splitting method for convex optimization.},

                  square root after performing the spectral projector

                  wave equation can lead to erroneous results,
                  especially when the number of iterations is too
                  high, which may lead to over fitting the
                  data. Several approaches have been proposed to
                  address this issue. Most commonly, people apply
                  "data-independent" filtering operations that are
                  aimed to deemphasize the elastic phases in the data
                  in favor of the acoustic phases. Examples of this
                  approach are nested loops over offset range and
                  Laplace parameters. In this paper, we discuss two
                  complementary optimization-driven methods where the
                  minimization process decides adaptively which of the
                  data or model components are consistent with the
                  objective. Specifically, we compare the Student's t

                  curvelet-domain sparsity promotion as the

                  methods to a realistic synthetic lead to comparable

                  observed data is not necessarily in the column space
                  of the linearized modelling operator. This can be
                  caused by lack of an accurate background velocity
                  model or by coherent noises not explained by
                  linearized modelling. Through carefully designed

                  sparse reconstruction lies a central question that
                  often goes unaddressed: is it better for the
                  transform-domain sparsity to be achieved through
                  explicit construction of sparse representations
                  (e.g., by thresholding of small transform-domain
                  coefficients), or by demanding that the algorithm
                  return physical signals which produces sparse
                  coefficients when hit with the forward transform?
                  Recent results show that the two approaches give
                  rise to different solutions when the transform is
                  redundant, and that the latter approach imposes a
                  whole new class of constraints related to where the

  abstract = {The advent of modern computing has made it possible to
                  do seismic imaging using least-squares reverse-time
                  migration. We obtain superior images by solving an
                  optimization problem that recovers the
                  true-amplitude images. However, its success hinges
                  on overcoming several issues, including overwhelming
                  problem size, unknown source wavelet, and
                  interfering coherent events like multiples. In this
                  abstract, we reduce the problem size by using ideas
                  from compressive sensing, and estimate source
                  wavelet by generalized variable projection. We also
                  demonstrate how to invert for subsurface information
                  encoded in surface-related multiples by
                  incorporating the free-surface operator as an areal
                  source in reverse-time migration. Our synthetic
                  examples show that multiples help to improve the
                  resolution of the image, as well as remove the
                  amplitude ambiguity in wavelet estimation.},

  booktitle = {EAGE Annual Conference Proceedings},
  year = {2013},

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion relies on minimizing the
                  difference between observed and modeled data, as
                  measured by some penalty function. A popular choice,
                  of course, is the least-squares penalty. However,
                  when outliers are present in the data, the use of
                  robust penalties such as the Huber or Student's t
                  may significantly improve the results since they put
                  relatively less weight on large residuals. In order
                  for robust penalties to be effective, the outliers
                  must be somehow localized and distinguishable from
                  the good data. We propose to first transform the
                  residual into a domain where the outliers are
                  localized before measuring the misfit with a robust
                  penalty. This is exactly how one would normally
                  devise filters to remove the noise before applying
                  conventional FWI. We propose to merge the two steps
                  and let the inversion process implicitly filter out
                  the noise. Results on a synthetic dataset show the
                  effectiveness of the approach.},

                  auxiliary information about how this data was

                  using sparsity optimization when the source

                  seismic applications. Back in 1970s, geophysicists
                  had well exploited the robustness of sparse
                  solutions. Moreover, with the emerging usage of
                  compressed sensing in recent years, sparse recovery

  abstract = {There are several factors that affect the repeatability
                  of 4D(time-lapse) seismic data. One of the most
                  significant factors is the repeatability of the
                  acquisition, particularly the locations of the
                  sources and receivers. It is important to repeat the
                  source-receiver locations, used during the baseline
                  survey, in the monitor or repeat survey. Also, it is
                  essential that the stacked data volumes used for
                  time-lapse analysis are created using the same
                  offset ranges for each survey. This condition is
                  crucial in order to be able to produce an image of
                  the same location over a period of time and enhances
                  proper reservoir characterization. The cost of
                  repeating the seismic acquisition is very expensive,
                  as often times, the receiver array has to be left at
                  the same location over the period for which the data
                  will be acquired. In other words, it is important to
                  repeat the acquisition geometry as much as
                  possible. In this talk, we investigate the results
                  of changing the acquisition geometry, by a random
                  placement of the receivers for both the baseline
                  surveys and newer (monitor) surveys. Results show
                  that we are still able to observe any time-lapse
                  effects from the proposed acquisition geometry. Our

  abstract = {Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a computational
                  procedure to extract medium parameters from seismic
                  data. FWI is typically formulated as a nonlinear
                  least squares optimization problem, and various
                  regularization techniques are used to guide the
                  optimization because the problem is illposed. In
                  this paper, we propose a novel sparse regularization
                  which exploits the ability of curvelets to
                  efficiently represent geophysical images. We then
                  formulate a corresponding sparsity promoting
                  constrained optimization problem, which we call
                  Nonlinear Basis Pursuit Denoise (NBPDN) and present
                  an algorithm to solve this problem to recover medium
                  parameters. The utility of the NBPDN formulation and

                  quality than the standard FWI formulation (solved

                  recover the sparse perturbation even when the data

                  sizes numerically. To address this fundamental
                  issue, we propose a randomized
                  dimensionality-reduction strategy motivated by
                  recent developments in stochastic optimization and
                  compressive sensing. In this formulation
                  conventional Gauss-Newton iterations are replaced by
                  dimensionality-reduced sparse recovery problems with
                  source encodings.},

                  procedure to extract medium parameters from seismic
                  data. FWI is typically formulated as a nonlinear
                  least squares optimization problem, and various
                  regularization techniques are used to guide the
                  optimization because the problem is ill-posed. We
                  propose a novel sparse regularization which exploits
                  the ability of curvelets to efficiently represent
                  geophysical images.  We then formulate a
                  corresponding sparsity promoting constrained
                  optimization problem, which we solve using an open
                  source algorithm. The techniques are applicable to
                  any inverse problem where sparsity modeling is
                  appropriate. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
                  formulation on a toy example (stylized cross-well
                  experiment) and on a realistic Seismic example
                  (partial Marmoussi model). We also discuss the
                  tradeoff between model fit and sparsity promotion,
                  with a view to extend existing techniques for linear

                  sensitivity to noise and in cases where modeling is
                  particularly poor or far from the real data
                  generating process. We survey previous robust
                  methods from a statistical perspective, and use this
                  perspective to derive a new robust method by
                  assuming the random errors in our model arise from
                  the Student's t-distribution. We show that in
                  contrast to previous robust methods, the new method
                  progres- sively down-weighs large outliers,
                  effectively ignoring them once they are large
                  enough. This suggests that the new method is more
                  robust and suitable for situations with very poor

                  new method recovers as well or better than previous
                  robust methods, and can recover models with quality
                  comparable to standard methods on noise-free data
                  when some of the data is completely corrupted, and
                  even when a marine acquisition mask is entirely
                  ignored in the modeling. The ability to ignore a
                  marine acquisition mask via robust FWI methods

                  functional. The demand for higher resolution images
                  in more geophysically complex areas drives the need
                  to develop techniques that handle problems of
                  tremendous size with limited computational
                  resources. While seismic imaging is amenable to
                  dimensionality reduction techniques that collapse
                  the data volume into a smaller set of "super-shots",
                  these techniques break down for complex acquisition

                  potential for non-uniqueness, and we present a

  abstract = {Source estimation is an essential component of full
                  waveform inversion. In the standard frequency domain
                  formulation, there is closed form solution for the
                  the optimal source weights, which can thus be
                  cheaply estimated on the fly. A growing body of work
                  underscores the importance of robust modeling for
                  data with large outliers or artifacts that are not
                  captured by the forward model. Effectively, the
                  least-squares penalty on the residual is replaced by
                  a robust penalty, such as Huber, Hybrid `1-`2 or
                  Student’s t. As we will demonstrate, it is essential
                  to use the same robust penalty for source
                  estimation. In this abstract, we present a general
                  approach to robust waveform inversion with robust
                  source estimation. In this general formulation,
                  there is no closed form solution for the optimal
                  source weights so we need to solve a scalar
                  optimization problem to obtain these weights.  We
                  can efficiently solve this optimization problem with
                  a Newton-like method in a few iterations. The
                  computational cost involved is of the same order as
                  the usual least-squares source estimation procedure.
                  We show numerical examples illustrating robust
                  source estimation and robust waveform inversion on
                  synthetic data with outliers.},

  abstract = {Recent advances based on the mathematical understanding
                  of the Hessian as, under certain conditions, a
                  pseudo-differential operator have resulted in a new
                  preconditioner by L. Demanet et al. Basing their
                  approach on a suitable basis expansion for the
                  Hessian, by suitably 'probing' the Hessian,
                  i.e. applying the Hessian to a small number of
                  randomized model perturbations, one can obtain an
                  approximation to the inverse Hessian in an efficient
                  manner. Building upon this approach, we consider
                  this preconditioner in the context of least-squares
                  migration and Full Waveform Inversion and
                  specifically dimensionality reduction techniques in
                  these domains. By utilizing previous work in
                  simultaneous sources, we are able to develop an
                  efficient least-squares migration scheme which
                  recovers higher quality images and hence higher
                  quality search directions in the context of a

  abstract = {From the measured seismic data, the location and the
                  amplitude of reflectors can be determined via a
                  migration algorithm. Classically, following
                  Claerbout{\textquoteright}s imaging principle [2], a
                  reflector is located at the position where the
                  source{\textquoteright}s forward-propagated
                  wavefield correlates with the backward-propagated
                  wavefield of the receiver data. Lailly and Tarantola
                  later showed that this imaging principle is an
                  instance of inverse problems, with the associated
                  migration operator formulated via a least-squares
                  functional; see [6, 12, 13]. Furthermore, they
                  showed that the migrated image is associated with
                  the gradient of this functional with respect to the
                  image. If the solution of the least-squares
                  functional is done iteratively, the
                  correlation-based image coincides up to a constant
                  with the first iteration of a gradient method. In
                  practice, this migration is done either in the time
                  domain or in the frequency domain. In the
                  frequency-domain migration, the main bottleneck thus
                  far, which renders its full implementation to large
                  scale problems, is the lack of efficient solvers for
                  computing wavefields. Robust direct methods easily
                  run into excessive memory requirements as the size
                  of the problem increases. On the other hand,
                  iterative methods, which are less demanding in terms
                  of memory, suffered from lack of convergence. During
                  the past years, however, progress has been made in
                  the development of an efficient iterative method [4,
                  3] for the frequency-domain wavefield
                  computations. In this paper, we will show the
                  significance of this method (called MKMG) in the
                  context of the frequency-domain migration, where
                  multi-shot-frequency wavefields (of order of 10,000
                  related wavefields) need to be computed.},

                  and wavefield extrapolation methods have proven to
                  be powerful methods to attenuate multiples from data
                  acquired in complex 3-D geologic environments.
                  These methods make use of a two-stage approach,
                  where first the multiples (surface-related and / or
                  internal) multiples are predicted before they are
                  subtracted from the original input data in an
                  adaptively. The quality of these predicted multiples
                  often raises high expectations for the adaptive
                  subtraction techniques, but for various reasons
                  these expectations are not always met in
                  practice. Standard adaptive subtraction methods use
                  the well-known minimum energy criterion, stating
                  that the total energy after optimal multiple
                  attenuation should be minimal. When primaries and
                  multiples interfere, the minimum energy criterion is
                  no longer appropriate. Also, when multiples of
                  different orders interfere, adaptive energy
                  minimization will lead to a compromise between
                  different amplitudes corrections for the different
                  orders of multiples. This paper investigates the
                  performance of two multiple subtraction schemes for
                  a real data set that exhibits both interference
                  problems. Results from an adaptive subtraction in
                  the real curvelet domain, separating primaries and
                  multiples, are compared to those obtained using a
                  more conventional adaptive subtraction method in the

                  to favor wavefield reconstruction by
                  sparsity-promoting inversion with transform elements
                  that are localized in the Fourier domain. Our work
                  is motivated by empirical observations in the
                  seismic community, corroborated by recent results
                  from compressive sampling, which indicate favorable
                  (wavefield) reconstructions from random as opposed
                  to regular undersampling. As predicted by theory,
                  random undersampling renders coherent aliases into
                  harmless incoherent random noise, effectively
                  turning the interpolation problem into a much
                  simpler denoising problem. A practical requirement
                  of wavefield reconstruction with localized
                  sparsifying transforms is the control on the maximum
                  gap size. Unfortunately, random undersampling does
                  not provide such a control and the main purpose of
                  this paper is to introduce a sampling scheme, coined
                  jittered undersampling, that shares the benefits of
                  random sampling, while offering control on the
                  maximum gap size. Our contribution of jittered
                  sub-Nyquist sampling proofs to be key in the
                  formulation of a versatile wavefield
                  sparsity-promoting recovery scheme that follows the
                  principles of compressive sampling. After studying
                  the behavior of the jittered-undersampling scheme in
                  the Fourier domain, its performance is studied for
                  curvelet recovery by sparsity-promoting inversion
                  (CRSI). Our findings on synthetic and real seismic
                  data indicate an improvement of several decibels

                  curves trace the optimal trade off between these two
                  competing aims. These curves are commonly used in
                  problems with two-norm priors where they are plotted
                  on a log-log scale and are known as L-curves. For
                  other priors, such as the sparsity-promoting one
                  norm, Pareto curves remain relatively
                  unexplored. First, we show how these curves provide
                  an objective criterion to gauge how robust one-norm

                  in the elastic properties of the
                  Earth{\textquoteright}s subsurface. Using the
                  high-frequency ray-Born approximation for scattering
                  from non-intersecting smooth interfaces, seismic
                  data can be represented by a generalized Radon
                  transform mapping the singularities in the medium to
                  seismic data. Even though seismic data are bandwidth
                  limited, signatures of the singularities in the
                  medium carry through this transform and its inverse
                  and this mapping property presents us with the
                  possibility to develop new imaging techniques that
                  preserve and characterize the singularities from
                  incomplete, bandwidth-limited and noisy data. In
                  this paper we propose a non-adaptive
                  Curvelet/Contourlet technique to image and preserve
                  the singularities and a data-adaptive Matching
                  Pursuit method to characterize these imaged
                  singularities by Multi-fractional Splines. This
                  first technique borrows from the ideas within the
                  Wavelet-Vaguelette/Quasi-SVD approach. We use the
                  almost diagonalization of the scattering operator to
                  approximately compensate for (i) the coloring of the
                  noise and hence facilitate estimation; (ii) the
                  normal operator itself. Results of applying these
                  techniques to seismic imaging are encouraging
                  although many open fundamental questions remain.},

                  increasingly relies on more and more sophisticated
                  algorithms that require multiple paths through all
                  data. This requirement leads to problems because the
                  size of seismic data volumes is increasing
                  exponentially, exposing bottlenecks in IO and
                  computational capability. To overcome these
                  bottlenecks, we follow recent trends in machine
                  learning and compressive sensing by proposing a
                  sparsity-promoting inversion technique that works on
                  small randomized subsets of data only. We boost the
                  performance of this algorithm significantly by
                  modifying a state-of-the-art l1-norm solver to
                  benefit from message passing, which breaks the build
                  up of correlations between model iterates and the
                  randomized linear forward model. We demonstrate the
                  performance of this algorithm on a toy
                  sparse-recovery problem and on a realistic
                  reverse-time-migration example with random source
                  encoding. The improvements in speed, memory use, and

                  identified. First, there is the so-called
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}curse of
                  dimensionality{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}
                  exemplified by Nyquist{\textquoteright}s sampling
                  criterion, which puts disproportionate strain on
                  current acquisition and processing systems as the
                  size and desired resolution of our survey areas
                  continues to increase. Secondly, there is the recent
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}departure from
                  Moore{\textquoteright}s
                  law{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} that forces us
                  to lower our expectations to compute ourselves out
                  of this curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we
                  offer a way out of this situation by a deliberate

                  structure-exploiting transform-domain sparsity
                  promotion. Our approach is successful because it
                  reduces the size of seismic data volumes without
                  loss of information. As such we end up with a new
                  technology where the costs of acquisition and
                  processing are no longer dictated by the size of the
                  acquisition but by the transform-domain sparsity of

                  transform-domain data volumes by only a small
                  factor. Because compressive sensing combines
                  transformation and encoding by a single linear
                  encoding step, this technology is directly
                  applicable to acquisition and to dimensionality
                  reduction during processing. In either case,
                  sampling, storage, and processing costs scale with
                  transform-domain sparsity. Many seismic exploration
                  techniques rely on the collection of massive data

                  between source- and residual wavefields. These
                  multi-dimensional correlations are computationally
                  expensive because they involve operations with
                  explicit and full matrices that contain both
                  wavefields. By leveraging recent insights from
                  compressive sampling, we present an alternative
                  method where linear correlation-based imaging is
                  replaced by imaging via multidimensional
                  deconvolutions of compressibly sampled wavefields.
                  Even though this approach goes at the expense of
                  having to solve a sparsity-promotion recovery
                  program for the image, our wavefield inversion
                  approach has the advantage of reducing the system
                  size in accordance to transform-domain sparsity of
                  the image. Because seismic images also exhibit a
                  focusing of the energy towards zero offset, the
                  compressive-wavefield inversion itself is carried
                  out using a recent extension of one-norm solver
                  technology towards matrix-valued problems. These
                  so-called hybrid $(1,\,2)$-norm solvers allow us to
                  penalize pre-stack energy away from zero offset
                  while exploiting joint sparsity amongst near-offset
                  images. Contrary to earlier work to reduce modeling
                  and imaging costs through random phase-encoded
                  sources, our method compressively samples wavefields
                  in model space. This approach has several advantages
                  amongst which improved system-size reduction, and
                  more flexibility during subsequent inversions for
                  subsurface properties.},

                  information during seismic processing. While this
                  approach has been extremely successful in the past,
                  the current trend of incessantly pushing for higher
                  quality images in increasingly complicated regions
                  of the Earth continues to reveal fundamental
                  shortcomings in our workflows to handle massive
                  high-dimensional data volumes. Two causes can be
                  identified as the main culprits responsible for this
                  barrier. First, there is the so-called
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}curse of
                  dimensionality{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}
                  exemplified by Nyquist{\textquoteright}s sampling
                  criterion, which puts disproportionate strain on
                  current acquisition and processing systems as the
                  size and desired resolution of our survey areas
                  continues to increase. Secondly, there is the recent
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}departure from
                  Moore{\textquoteright}s
                  law{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} that forces us
                  to lower our expectations to compute ourselves out
                  of this curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we
                  offer a way out of this situation by a deliberate
                  \emph{randomized} subsampling combined with
                  structure-exploiting transform-domain sparsity
                  promotion. Our approach is successful because it
                  reduces the size of seismic data volumes without
                  loss of information. Because of this size reduction
                  both impediments are removed and we end up with a
                  new technology where the costs of acquisition and
                  processing are no longer dictated by the \emph{size
                  of the acquisition} but by the transform-domain
                  \emph{sparsity} of the end-product after

  abstract = {Seismic data processing and imaging are firmly rooted in
                  the well-established paradigm of regular Nyquist
                  sampling. Faced with a typical uncooperative
                  environment, practitioners of seismic data
                  acquisition make all efforts to comply to this
                  theory by creating regularly-sampled seismic-data
                  volumes that are suitable for Fourier-based
                  processing flows. The current advent of new
                  alternative transform domains{\textendash}- such as
                  the sparsifying curvelet domain, where seismic data
                  is decomposed into localized, multiscale and
                  multidirectional plane waves{\textendash}- opens the
                  possibility to change this paradigm by no longer
                  combating sampling irregularity but by embracing
                  it. During this talk, we show that as long as
                  seismic data volumes permit a compressible
                  representation{\textendash}-i.e., data can be
                  represented as a superposition of relatively few
                  number of elementary waveforms{\textendash}- Nyquist
                  sampling is unnecessary pessimistic. So far, nothing
                  new, we all know from the work on Fourier- or other
                  transform-based seismic-data regularization
                  methodologies that wavefields can be recovered
                  accurately from sub-Nyquist samplings through some
                  sort of optimization procedure. What is new,
                  however, are recent insights from the field of
                  "compressive sampling", which dictate the conditions
                  that guarantee or, at least, in practice provide
                  conditions that favor sparsity-promoting recovery
                  from sub-Nyquist sampling. Random sub-sampling, or
                  to be more precise, jitter sub-sampling creates
                  favorable conditions for curvelet-based recovery. We
                  explain this phenomenon by arguing that this type of
                  sampling leads to noisy data, hence our slogan
                  "Simply denoise: wavefield reconstruction via
                  jittered undersampling", where we bank on separating
                  incoherent sub-sampling noise with curvelet-domain
                  sparsity promotion. During our presentation, we
                  introduce you to what curvelets are, why random
                  jitter sampling is important and why this opens a
                  pathway towards a new paradigm of curvelet-domain
                  seismic data processing. Our claims will be
                  supported by examples on synthetic and field
                  data. This is joint work with Gilles Hennenfent,

                  the predictions are matched to the actual
                  to-be-separated wavefield components in the observed
                  data. The success of these wavefield matching

                  primaries and multiples greatly determines the
                  quality of seismic imaging. Despite major advances
                  made by Surface-Related Multiple Elimination (SRME),
                  amplitude errors in the predicted multiples remain a
                  problem. When these errors vary for each type of
                  multiple differently (as a function of offset, time
                  and dip), these amplitude errors pose a serious
                  challenge for conventional least-squares matching
                  and for the recently introduced separation by
                  curvelet-domain thresholding. We propose a
                  data-adaptive method that corrects amplitude errors,
                  which vary smoothly as a function of location, scale
                  (frequency band) and angle. In that case, the
                  amplitudes can be corrected by an element-wise
                  curvelet-domain scaling of the predicted
                  multiples. We show that this scaling leads to a
                  successful estimation of the primaries, despite
                  amplitude, sign, timing and phase errors in the
                  predicted multiples. Our results on synthetic and
                  real data show distinct improvements over
                  conventional least-squares matching, in terms of
                  better suppression of multiple energy and

  abstract = {Inverse problems in (exploration) seismology are known
                  for their large to very large scale. For instance,
                  certain sparsity-promoting inversion techniques
                  involve vectors that easily exceed 230 unknowns
                  while seismic imaging involves the construction and
                  application of matrix-free discretized operators
                  where single matrix-vector evaluations may require
                  hours, days or even weeks on large compute
                  clusters. For these reasons, software development in
                  this field has remained the domain of highly
                  technical codes programmed in low-level languages
                  with little eye for easy development, code reuse and
                  integration with (nonlinear) programs that solve
                  inverse problems. Following ideas from the
                  Symes{\textquoteright} Rice Vector Library and
                  Bartlett{\textquoteright}s C++ object-oriented
                  interface, Thyra, and Reduction/Transformation
                  operators (both part of the Trilinos software
                  package), we developed a software-development
                  environment based on overloading. This environment
                  provides a pathway from in-core prototype
                  development to out-of-core and MPI
                  {\textquoteright}production{\textquoteright} code
                  with a high level of code reuse. This code reuse is
                  accomplished by integrating the out-of-core and MPI
                  functionality into the dynamic object-oriented
                  programming language Python. This integration is
                  implemented through operator overloading and allows
                  for the development of a coordinate-free solver
                  framework that (i) promotes code reuse; (ii)
                  analyses the statements in an abstract syntax tree
                  and (iii) generates executable statements. In the
                  current implementation, we developed an interface to
                  generate executable statements for the out-of-core
                  unix-pipe based (seismic) processing package
                  RSF-Madagascar (rsf.sf.net). The modular design
                  allows for interfaces to other seismic processing
                  packages and to in-core Python packages such as
                  numpy. So far, the implementation overloads linear
                  operators and elementwise reduction/transformation
                  operators. We are planning extensions towards
                  nonlinear operators and integration with existing
                  (parallel) solver frameworks such as Trilinos.},

                  of (extremely) large data volumes is collapsed onto
                  the Earth's reflectors. We show how the ideas from
                  "compressive sampling" can alleviate this task by
                  exploiting the curvelet transform's "wavefront-set
                  detection" capability and "invariance" property
                  under wave propagation. First, a wavelet-vaguellete
                  technique is reviewed, where seismic amplitudes are
                  recovered from complete data by diagonalizing the
                  Gramm matrix of the linearized scattering
                  problem. Next, we show how the recovery of seismic
                  wavefields from incomplete data can be cast into a
                  compressive sampling problem, followed by a proposal
                  to compress wavefield extrapolation operators via
                  compressive sampling in the modal domain. During the

  title = {Phase transitions in explorations seismology: statistical mechanics meets information theory},
  booktitle = {COIP},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {In this paper, two different applications of phase
                  transitions to exploration seismology will be
                  discussed. The first application concerns a phase
                  diagram ruling the recovery conditions for seismic
                  data volumes from incomplete and noisy data while
                  the second phase transition describes the behavior
                  of bi-compositional mixtures as a function of the
                  volume fraction. In both cases, the phase
                  transitions are the result of randomness in large
                  system of equations in combination with
                  nonlinearity. The seismic recovery problem from
                  incomplete data involves the inversion of a
                  rectangular matrix. Recent results from the field of
                  "compressive sensing" provide the conditions for a
                  successful recovery of functions that are sparse in
                  some basis (wavelet) or frame (curvelet)
                  representation, by means of a sparsity
                  ($\ell_1$-norm) promoting nonlinear program. The
                  conditions for a successful recovery depend on a
                  certain randomness of the matrix and on two
                  parameters that express the matrix{\textquoteright}
                  aspect ratio and the ratio of the number of nonzero
                  entries in the coefficient vector for the sparse
                  signal representation over the number of
                  measurements. It appears that the ensemble average
                  for the success rate for the recovery of the sparse
                  transformed data vector by a nonlinear sparsity
                  promoting program, can be described by a phase
                  transition, demarcating the regions for the two
                  ratios for which recovery of the sparse entries is
                  likely to be successful or likely to
                  fail. Consistent with other phase transition
                  phenomena, the larger the system the sharper the
                  transition. The randomness in this example is
                  related to the construction of the matrix, which for
                  the recovery of spike trains corresponds to the
                  randomly restricted Fourier matrix. It is shown,
                  that these ideas can be extended to the curvelet
                  recovery by sparsity-promoting inversion (CRSI). The
                  second application of phase transitions in
                  exploration seismology concerns the upscaling
                  problem. To counter the intrinsic smoothing of
                  singularities by conventional equivalent medium
                  upscaling theory, a percolation-based nonlinear
                  switch model is proposed. In this model, the
                  transport properties of bi-compositional mixture
                  models for rocks undergo a sudden change in the
                  macroscopic transport properties as soon as the
                  volume fraction of the stronger material reaches a
                  critical point. At this critical point, the stronger
                  material forms a connected cluster, which leads to
                  the creation of a cusp-like singularity in the
                  elastic moduli, which in turn give rise to specular
                  reflections. In this model, the reflectivity is no
                  longer explicitly due to singularities in the rocks
                  composition. Instead, singularities are created
                  whenever the volume fraction exceeds the critical
                  point. We will show that this concept can be used
                  for a singularity-preserved lithological upscaling.},

                  propagation. Because of excessive memory
                  requirements, explicit formulations for wave
                  propagation have proven to be a challenge in 3-D. By

                  incomplete set of measurements when the measurement
                  basis is incoherent with the representation in which

                  eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz operator are
                  recognized as a basis that is incoherent with
                  curvelets that are known to compress seismic

                  successful prediction and subsequent removal of

                  represented that tackles this challenge in a
                  two-step approach. During the first step, the
                  recently developed curvelet-based recovery by
                  sparsity-promoting inversion (CRSI) is applied to
                  the data, followed by a prediction of the
                  primaries. During the second high-resolution step,
                  the estimated primaries are used to improve the
                  frequency content of the recovered data by combining
                  the focal transform, defined in terms of the
                  estimated primaries, with the curvelet
                  transform. This focused curvelet transform leads to
                  an improved recovery, which can subsequently be used
                  as input for a second stage of multiple prediction

                  such as the curvelet transform, to provide estimates

                  that provides (possibly) erroneous predictions of

                  solving an optimization problem that assumes noisy
                  input data and can be derived from a Bayesian
                  perspective. More precisely, the optimization

                  energy in the result or may lead to a distortion of
                  the primaries, or both. To reduce these adverse
                  effects, a new transformed-domain method is proposed
                  where primaries and multiples are separated rather

                  l1-norms) in the transformed domain subject to
                  fitting the observed data as the sum of the
                  separated components to within a user-defined
                  tolerance level. Whenever the prediction for the two
                  signal components in the transformed domain
                  correlate, the recovery is suppressed while for
                  regions where the correlation is small the method
                  seeks the sparsest set of coefficients that
                  represent each signal component. Our algorithm does
                  not seek a matched filter and as such it differs
                  fundamentally from traditional adaptive subtraction
                  methods. The method derives its stability from the
                  sparseness obtained by a non-parametric multiscale
                  and multidirectional overcomplete signal
                  representation. This sparsity serves as prior
                  information and allows for a Bayesian interpretation
                  of our method during which the log-likelihood
                  function is minimized while the two signal
                  components are assumed to be given by a
                  superposition of prototype waveforms, drawn
                  independently from a probability function that is
                  weighted by the predicted primaries and
                  multiples. In this paper, the predictions are based
                  on the data-driven surface-related multiple
                  elimination (SRME) method. Synthetic and field data
                  examples show a clean separation leading to a
                  considerable improvement in multiple suppression
                  compared to the conventional method of adaptive
                  matched filtering. This improved separation
                  translates into an improved stack.},

                  the computational cost of solving forward modeling
                  problems has become{\textendash}-aside from issues
                  with non-uniqueness{\textendash}-one of the major
                  impediments withstanding successful application of
                  this technology to industry-size data volumes. To
                  overcome this impediment, we argue that further
                  improvements in this area will depend on a problem
                  formulation with a computational complexity that is
                  no longer strictly determined by the size of the
                  discretization but by transform-domain sparsity of
                  its solution. In this new paradigm, we bring
                  computational costs in par with our ability to
                  compress seismic data and images. This premise is
                  related to two recent developments. First, there is
                  the new field of compressive sensing (CS in short
                  throughout the paper, Cand{\textquoteleft}es et al.,
                  2006; Donoho, 2006){\textendash}-where the argument
                  is made, and rigorously proven, that compressible
                  signals can be recovered from severely sub-Nyquist
                  sampling by solving a sparsity promoting
                  program. Second, there is in the seismic community
                  the recent resurgence of simultaneous-source
                  acquisition (Beasley, 2008; Krohn and Neelamani,
                  2008; Herrmann et al., 2009; Berkhout, 2008;
                  Neelamani et al., 2008), and continuing efforts to
                  reduce the cost of seismic modeling, imaging, and
                  inversion through phase encoding of simultaneous
                  sources (Morton and Ober, 1998; Romero et al., 2000;
                  Krohn and Neelamani, 2008; Herrmann et al., 2009),

                  al., 2008) or plane waves (Vigh and Starr, 2008). By
                  using CS principles, we remove sub-sampling
                  interferences asocciated with these approaches
                  through a combination of exploiting transform-domain
                  sparsity, properties of certain sub-sampling
                  schemes, and the existence of sparsity promoting

                  main steps: a prediction step, in which multiples

                  design acquisitions that favour recovery by sparsity

                  symmetric in the source and receiver
                  coordinates. Often seismic data sets are incomplete
                  and the missing data must be
                  interpolated. Typically, missing traces do not occur
                  symmetrically. The purpose of this project is to
                  extend the current formulation for solving the
                  seismic interpolation problems in such a way that
                  they enforce reciprocity. The method decomposes the
                  seismic data volume into symmetric and antisymmetric
                  parts. This decomposition leads to an augmented
                  system of equations for the L1-solver that promotes
                  sparsity in the curvelet domain. Interpolation is
                  carried out on the entire system during which the

                  step in seismic data processing. The industry
                  standard for removing multiples is SRME, which
                  involves convolving the data with itself to predict
                  the multiples, followed by an adaptive subtraction
                  procedure to recover the primaries (Verschuur and
                  Berkhout, 1997). Other methods involve
                  multidimensional division of the up-going and
                  down-going wavefields (Amundsen, 2001). However,
                  this approach may suffer from stability
                  problems. With the introduction of the

                  primaries by sparse

                  van Groenestijn and Verschuur (2009) recentely
                  reformulated SRME to jointly estimate the
                  surface-free impulse response and the source
                  signature directly from the data. The advantage of
                  EPSI is that it recovers the primary response
                  directly, and does not require a second processing
                  step for the subtraction of estimated multiples from
                  the original data. However, because it estimates
                  both the primary impulse response and source
                  signature from the data EPSI must be regularized.
                  Motivated by recent successful application of the
                  curvelet transform in seismic data processing
                  (Herrmann et al., 2007), we formulate EPSI as a
                  bi-convex optimization problem that seeks sparsity
                  on the surface-free Green{\textquoteright}s function
                  and Fourier-domain smoothness on the source
                  wavelet. Our main contribution compared to previous
                  work (Lin and Herrmann, 2009), and the contribution
                  of that author to the proceedings of this
                  meeting(Lin and Herrmann, 2010), is that we employ
                  the physical principle of as source-receiver
                  reciprocity to improve the inversion.},

                  seismic data processing. By noise we refer to the
                  incoherent noise that is present in the data. We use
                  the recently introduced multiscale and
                  multidirectional curvelet transform for suppression
                  of random noise. The curvelet transform decomposes
                  data into directional plane waves that are local in
                  nature. The coherent features of the data occupy the
                  large coefficients in the curvelet domain, whereas
                  the incoherent noise lives in the small
                  coefficients. In other words, signal and noise have
                  minimal overlap in the curvelet domain. This gives
                  us a chance to use curvelets to suppress noise

                  curvelet and surfacelet transforms to seismic data
                  processing. The first application is stable signal
                  recovery in the physical domain - seismic data
                  acquisition is often limited by physical and
                  economic constraints, and the goal is to interpolate
                  the data from a given subset of seismic traces. The
                  second application is signal recovery in a transform
                  domain - we assume that our data comes in a form of
                  a random subset of temporal frequencies and the goal
                  is to recover the missing frequencies from this
                  data. Since seismic signals are generally not
                  bandwidth limited, this in fact becomes an
                  anti-aliasing problem. In both these problems the
                  recovery is resolved via a robust $\ell$_1 solver
                  that exploits the sparsity of the signals in
                  curvelet/surfacelet domains. In the last application

  abstract = {Present-day high quality 3D acquisition can give us
                  lower frequencies and longer offsets with which to
                  invert. However, the computational costs involved in
                  handling this data explosion are
                  tremendous. Therefore, recent developments in
                  full-waveform inversion have been geared towards
                  reducing the computational costs involved. A key
                  aspect of several approaches that have been proposed
                  is a dramatic reduction in the number of sources
                  used in each iteration. A reduction in the number of
                  sources directly translates to less PDE-solves and
                  hence a lower computational cost. Recent attention
                  has been drawn towards reducing the sources by
                  randomly combining the sources in to a few
                  supershots, but other strategies are also
                  possible. In all cases, the full data misfit, which
                  involves all the sequential sources, is replaced by
                  a reduced misfit that is much cheaper to evaluate
                  because it involves only a small number of sources
                  (batchsize). The batchsize controls the accuracy
                  with which the reduced misfit approximates the full
                  misfit. The optimization of such an inaccurate, or
                  noisy, misfit is the topic of stochastic
                  optimization. In this paper, we propose an
                  optimization strategy that borrows ideas from the
                  field of stochastic optimization. The main idea is
                  that in the early stage of the optimization, far
                  from the true model, we do not need a very accurate
                  misfit. The strategy consists of gradually
                  increasing the batchsize as the iterations
                  proceed. We test the proposed strategy on a
                  synthetic dataset. We achieve a very reasonable
                  inversion result at the cost of roughly 13
                  evaluations of the full misfit. We observe a
                  speed-up of roughly a factor 20.},

                  improvements in acquisition and inversion have been
                  substantial, but these improvements come at a high
                  cost because FWI involves extremely large
                  multi-experiment data volumes. The main obstacle is
                  the "curse of dimensionality" exemplified by
                  NyquistÕs sampling criterion, which puts a
                  disproportionate strain on current acquisition and

                  dimensionality reduction of the FWI problem adapted
                  from the field of CS. We invert for model updates by
                  replacing the Gauss-Newton linearized subproblem for
                  subsampled FWI with a sparsity promoting
                  formulation, and solve this formulation using the
                  SPGl1 algorithm. We speed up the algorithm and avoid
                  overfitting the data by solving for the linearized
                  updates only approximately. Our approach is
                  successful because it reduces the size of seismic
                  data volumes without loss of information. With this
                  reduction, we can compute a Newton-like update with
                  the reduced data volume at the cost of roughly one
                  gradient update for the fully sampled wavefield.},

                  fitting procedure based on seismic data to derive a
                  accurate velocity model. With the increasing demand
                  for high resolution images in complex geological
                  settings, the importance of improvements in
                  acquisition and inversion become more and more
                  critical. However, these improvements will be
                  obtained at high computational cost, as a typical
                  marine survey contains thousands of shot and
                  receiver positions, and FWI needs several passes
                  through massive seismic data. Computational cost of
                  FWI will grow exponentially as the size of seismic
                  data and desired resolution increase. In this paper
                  we present a modified Gauss-Newton (GN) method that

                  computational costs of the problem, whilst we
                  control information loss by redrawing a different

                  multiple iterations to minimize the least-squares
                  misfit as a function of the medium
                  perturbation. Unfortunately, the cost for these
                  iterations are prohibitive because each iteration
                  requires many wave-equation simulations, which
                  without direct solvers require an expensive separate
                  solve for each source. To overcome this problem, we
                  use dimensionality-reduction to decrease the size of
                  seismic imaging problem by turning the large number
                  of sequential shots into a much small number of
                  simultaneous shots. In our approach, we take
                  advantage of sparsifying transforms to remove source
                  crosstalk resulting from randomly weighting and
                  stacking sequential shots into a few super shots. We
                  also take advantage of the fact that the convergence
                  of large-scale sparsity-promoting solvers can be
                  improved significantly by borrowing ideas from
                  message passing, which are designed to break
                  correlation built up between the linear system and
                  the model iterate. In this way, we arrive at a
                  formulation where we run the sparsity-promoting
                  solver for a relatively large number of very
                  iterations. Aside from leading to a significant
                  speed up, our approach had the advantage of greatly
                  reducing the memory imprint and IO requirements. We
                  demonstrate this feature by solving a
                  sparsity-promoting imaging problem with operators of
                  reverse-time migration, which is computationally
                  infeasible without the dimensionality reduction.},

                  identified. First, there is the so-called

                  current acquisition and processing systems as the

                  there is the recent
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}departure from
                  Moore{\textquoteright}s
                  law{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} that forces us

                  randomized dimensionality reduction, which we adapt
                  from the field of compressive sensing. In this
                  approach, we combine deliberate randomized
                  subsampling with structure-exploiting
                  transform-domain sparsity promotion. Our approach is

                  computing wavefield propagation which improved on
                  the previously employed local explicit operator
                  method in that it exhibited no dip limitation,
                  accurately handled laterally varying background
                  ground velocity models, and is unconditionally
                  stable. These desirable properties are mainly
                  attributed to bringing the propagation problem into
                  an eigenvector basis that diagonalizes the
                  propagation operators. This modal-transform method,
                  however, requires at each depth-level the solution
                  of a large-scale sparse eigenvalue problem to
                  compute the square-root of the Helmholtz
                  operator. By using recent results from compressed
                  sensing, we hope to reduce these computational costs
                  that typically involve the synthesizes of the
                  imaging operators and the cost of matrix-vector
                  products.  To reduce these costs, we compress the
                  extrapolation operators by using only a fraction of
                  the positive eigenvalues and temporal frequencies.
                  This reduction not only leads to smaller matrices
                  but also to reduced synthesis costs. These
                  reductions go at the expense of solving a recovery
                  problem from incomplete data. During the

                  be extrapolated with a compressed operators and

                  major impediment within seismic imaging. By turning

                  sampling the sources, followed by solving a reduced

                  reconstructing the primary events in a hybrid
                  wavelet-curvelet representation domain. EPSI is a
                  multiple removal technique that belongs to the class
                  of wavefield inversion methods, as an alternative to
                  the traditional adaptive-subtraction process. The
                  main assumption is that the correct primary events
                  should be as sparsely-populated in time as
                  possible. A convex reformulation of the original
                  EPSI algorithm allows its convergence property to be
                  preserved even when the solution wavefield is not
                  formed in the physical domain. Since wavefronts and
                  edge-type singularities are sparsely represented in
                  the curvelet domain, sparse solutions formed in this

                  on a particular wavefield-inversion approach to the
                  popular SRME multiple removal technique called
                  Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (EPSI).
                  EPSI promises greatly improved tolerance to noise,
                  missing data, edge effect, and other physi- cal
                  phenomenon generally not described by the SRME
                  relation (van Groenestijn and Verschuur,
                  2009a,b). It is based on the premise that it is
                  possible to stably invert for both the primary
                  impulse response and the source signature despite
                  beforehand having no (or very limited) explicit
                  knowledge of latter. The key to successful
                  applications of EPSI, as shown in very recent works
                  (Savels et al., 2010), is a robust way to
                  reconstruct very sparse primary impulse response
                  events as part of the inversion process. Based on
                  the various successful demonstrations in literature,
                  there is a very strong sense that EPSI will also
                  play an important role in future developments of
                  source sig- nature deconvolution and the general
                  recovering of wavefield spectrum.},

                  recent method for surface-related multiple removal
                  using a direct estimation method closely related to
                  Amundsen inversion, where under a sparsity
                  assumption the primary impulse response is
                  determined directly from a data-driven wavefield
                  inversion process. One of the major difficulties in
                  its practical adoption is that one must have precise
                  knowledge of a time-window that contains
                  multiple-free primaries during each
                  update. Moreover, due to the nuances involved in
                  regularizing the model impulse response in the
                  inverse problem, the EPSI approach has an additional
                  number of inversion parameters where it may be
                  difficult to choose a reasonable value. We show that
                  the specific sparsity constraint on the EPSI updates
                  lead to an inherently intractable problem, and that
                  the time-window and other inversion variables arise
                  in the context of additional regularizations that
                  attempts to drive towards a meaningful solution. We
                  furthermore suggest a way to remove almost all of
                  these parameters via convexification, which
                  stabilizes the inversion while preserving the
                  crucial sparsity assumption in the primary impulse

                  simultaneous acquisition scheme by applying the

                  acquisition in a compressive sensing setting we
                  immediately gain insight into not only how to choose
                  the source signature and shot patterns, but also in
                  how well we can hope to demultiplex the data when
                  given a set amount of reduction in the number of
                  sweeps. The principles of compressive sensing
                  dictates that the quality of the demultiplexed data
                  is closely related to the transform-domain sparsity
                  of the solution. This means that, given an estimate

                  it is possible to controllably reduce the number of

                  signal processing with the physics of wave
                  propagation. Because of excessive memory
                  requirements, explicit formulations for wave
                  propagation have proven to be a challenge in 3-D. By
                  using ideas from
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}compressed
                  sensing{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}, we are
                  able to formulate the (inverse) wavefield
                  extrapolation problem on small subsets of the data
                  volume, thereby reducing the size of the
                  operators. According to compressed sensing theory,
                  signals can successfully be recovered from an
                  imcomplete set of measurements when the measurement
                  basis is incoherent with the representation in which
                  the wavefield is sparse. In this new approach, the
                  eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz operator are
                  recognized as a basis that is incoherent with
                  curvelets that are known to compress seismic
                  wavefields. By casting the wavefield extrapolation
                  problem in this framework, wavefields can
                  successfully be extrapolated in the modal domain via
                  a computationally cheaper operation. A proof of

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a support driven reweighted
                  $\ell_1$ minimization algorithm (SDRL1) that solves
                  a sequence of weighted $\ell_1$ problems and relies
                  on the support estimate accuracy. Our SDRL1
                  algorithm is related to the IRL1 algorithm proposed
                  by Candes, Wakin, and Boyd. We demonstrate that it
                  is sufficient to find support estimates with good
                  accuracy and apply constant weights instead of using
                  the inverse coefficient magnitudes to achieve gains
                  similar to those of IRL1. We then prove that given a
                  support estimate with sufficient accuracy, if the
                  signal decays according to a specific rate, the
                  solution to the weighted $\ell_1$ minimization
                  problem results in a support estimate with higher
                  accuracy than the initial estimate. We also show
                  that under certain conditions, it is possible to
                  achieve higher estimate accuracy when the
                  intersection of support estimates is considered. We
                  demonstrate the performance of SDRL1 through
                  numerical simulations and compare it with that of
                  IRL1 and standard $\ell_1$ minimization.},

  title = {Recent results on seismic deconvolution},
  booktitle = {SINBAD 2006},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {One of the important steps in seismic imaging is to
                  provide suitable information about boundaries. Sharp
                  variation of physical properties at a layer boundary
                  cause reflection the wavefield. In previous work
                  done by C. M. Dupuis, seismic signal
                  characterization is divided into two steps:
                  detection and estimation. In the detection phase,
                  the goal is to find all singularities in a seismic
                  section regardless of their order and then to
                  categorize the data to different events by windowing
                  each singularity. In the estimation step, we
                  determine the order of singularity more precisely by
                  using a rough estimate based on the detection
                  phase. Traditionally, a redundant dictionary method
                  is employed for the detection part. However, we
                  attempt to instead use a new L1-solver developed by
                  D.L. Donoho: the Stagewise Orthogonal Matching
                  Pursuit (StOMP). It approximates the solution to
                  inverse problems while promoting the sparsity in the
                  solution vector. This algorithm will allow us to
                  experimentally confirm the recent analysis by
                  S. Mallat on spiky deconvolution limits, which
                  imposes a required minimum distance between
                  spikes. This required minimum distance between
                  different spikes is dependent on the number of
                  spikes as well as the width of the chosen source
                  wavelet used in convolution with the train. These
                  results allow for the design of more robust and
                  accurate detection schemes for seismic signal
                  characterization.},

  abstract = {Seismic transitions of the subsurface are typically
                  considered as zero-order singularities (step
                  functions). According to this model, the
                  conventional deconvolution problem aims at
                  recovering the seismic reflectivity as a sparse
                  spike train. However, recent multiscale analysis on
                  sedimentary records revealed the existence of
                  accumulations of varying order singularities in the
                  subsurface, which give rise to fractional-order
                  discontinuities. This observation not only calls for
                  a richer class of seismic reflection waveforms, but
                  it also requires a different methodology to detect
                  and characterize these reflection events. For
                  instance, the assumptions underlying conventional
                  deconvolution no longer hold. Because of the
                  bandwidth limitation of seismic data, multiscale
                  analysis methods based on the decay rate of wavelet
                  coefficients may yield ambiguous results. We avoid
                  this problem by formulating the estimation of the
                  singularity orders by a parametric nonlinear

  title = {Re-establishment of gradient in frequency-domain elastic waveform inversion},
  booktitle = {CSEG Annual Conference Proceedings},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {To obtain solutions close to global minimum in waveform
                  inversion, the gradients computed at each frequency
                  need to be weighted to appropriately describe the
                  residuals between modeled and field data. While the
                  low-frequency components of the gradients should be
                  weighted to recover the long-wavelength structures,
                  the high-frequency components of the gradients need
                  to be weighted when the short-wavelength structures
                  are restored. However, the conventional elastic
                  waveform inversion algorithms cannot properly weight
                  the gradients computed at each frequency. When
                  gradients are scaled using the pseudo-Hessian matrix
                  inside the frequency loop, gradients obtained at
                  high frequencies are over-emphasized. When the
                  gradients are scaled outside the frequency loop,
                  gradients are weighted by the source spectra. In
                  this study, we propose applying weighting factors to
                  the gradients obtained at each frequency so that
                  gradients can properly reflect the differences
                  between the true and assumed models satisfying the
                  general inverse theory. The weighting factors are
                  composed by the backpropagated residuals. Numerical
                  examples for the simple rectangular-shaped model and
                  the modified version of the Marmousi-2 model show
                  that the weighting method enhances gradient images
                  and inversion results compared to the conventional

                  that inversion results are very sensitive to initial

                  at each frequency are not properly weighted
                  depending on given models.Analyzingthe conventional
                  waveform inversion algorithms using the
                  pseudo-Hessian matrix as a pre-conditioner shows
                  that the gradientsdo not properly describe the

  abstract = {Geophysical processing is dominated by many different
                  out of core memory software environments
                  (OOCE). Such environments include Madagascar and SU
                  and are designed to handle data that can not be
                  operated on in memory. Each base operation is
                  created as a main program that reads data from disk
                  and writes the result to disk. The main programs can
                  also be chained together on stdin/out pipes using a
                  shell only writing data to disk at the end. To be
                  efficient, the algorithm using an OOCE must chain
                  together the longest pipe to avoid disk I/O, as a
                  result it is very difficult to use iterative
                  techniques. The algorithms are written in shell
                  scripts can be difficult to read and understand.
                  SLIMpy is a software library that contains
                  definitions of coordinate free vectors and linear
                  operators. It allows the user to design and run
                  algorithms with any out of core package, in a Matlab
                  style interface while maintaining optimal efficiency
                  and speed. SLIMpy looks at each main program of each
                  OOCE as a Matrix vector operation or vector
                  reduction/transformation operation. It uses operator
                  overloading to generate an abstract syntax tree
                  (AST) which can be optimized in many ways before
                  executing its commands. The AST also provides a
                  pathway for embarrassingly parallel applications by
                  splitting the tree over different nodes and
                  processors. SLIMpy provides an interface to these
                  OOCE that allows for optimal construction of
                  commands and allows for iterative techniques. It
                  smoothes the transition from other languages such as
                  Matlab and allows the algorithm designer to write
                  readable and reusable code. SLIMpy also adds to OOCE
                  by allowing for easy parallelization.},

                  results in image artifacts and poor spatial
                  resolution. Therefore, before being used, the

                  grid. One of the methods achieving this objective is
                  based on the Fourier reconstruction, which deals
                  with the under-determined system of equations. The

                  to the Fourier-based interpolation problem for the
                  signals that have sparse Fourier spectra. In
                  particular, the objective of the presentation
                  includes: 1). studying the performance of the
                  algorithm if, and how far, the measurement
                  coordinates can be shifted from uniform distribution
                  on the continuous interval. 2). studying what could
                  be the allowable misplacement in the measurement
                  coordinates that does not alter the quality of the
                  reconstruction process},

                  one often uses seismic data with missing traces. The
                  use of such data results in image artifacts and poor
                  spatial resolution. Sometimes due to practical
                  limitations, measurements may be available on a
                  perturbed grid, instead of on the designated
                  grid. Due to algorithmic requirements, when such
                  measurements are viewed as those on the designated
                  grid, the recovery procedures may result in
                  additional artifacts. This paper interpolates
                  incomplete data onto regular grid via the Fourier
                  domain, using a recently developed greedy
                  algorithm. The basic objective is to study
                  experimentally as to what could be the size of the
                  perturbation in measurement coordinates that allows
                  for the measurements on the perturbed grid to be
                  considered as on the designated grid for faithful
                  recovery. Our experimental work shows that for
                  compressible signals, a uniformly distributed
                  perturbation can be offset with slightly more number
                  of measurements.},

                  weighting in the curvelet domain. In that paper, a
                  smoothness constraint was introduced in the phase
                  space of the operator in order to regularize the
                  solution to make it unique.  In this paper, we use

                  reconstruction scheme called Curvelet-based Recovery
                  by Sparsity-promoting Inversion (CRSI) has been
                  developed, and has proven to be useful for seismic
                  data processing. One of the most important issues
                  for CRSI is the sampling scheme, which can greatly
                  affect the quality of reconstruction. Unlike usual
                  regular undersampling, stochastic sampling can
                  convert aliases to easy-to-eliminate noise. Some
                  stochastic sampling methods have been developed for
                  CRSI, e.g. jittered sampling, however most have only
                  been applied to 1D sampling along a line. Seismic
                  datasets are usually higher dimensional and very
                  large, thus it is desirable and often necessary to
                  develop higher dimensional sampling methods to deal
                  with these data. For dimensions higher than one, few
                  results have been reported, except uniform random
                  sampling, which does not perform well. In the
                  present paper, we explore 2D sampling methodologies
                  for curvelet-based reconstruction, possessing
                  sampling spectra with blue noise characteristics,
                  such as Poisson Disk sampling, Farthest Point
                  Sampling, and the 2D extension of jittered
                  sampling. These sampling methods are shown to lead
                  to better recovery and results are compared to the
                  other more traditional sampling protocols.},

                  estimation by sparse inversion has demonstrated its
                  superiority over surface-related multiple removal in

                  diagonal-plus low-rank quadratic approximation to
                  the function. The quadratic approximation is
                  constructed using a limited-memory quasi-Newton

                  source and receiver wavefields. For a kinematically
                  correct velocity, most of the energy will be
                  concentrated at zero offset. Because of the
                  computational cost involved in correlating the

                  computed for a subsurface offset that is aligned

                  structures, whereas the specular reflections

                  the seismic data in a specular reflecting and a

                  acquisition calls for development of a new set of
                  design principles and post-processing
                  tools. Leveraging developments from the field of
                  compressive sensing the focus here is on
                  simultaneous-acquisition design and
                  sequential-source data recovery. Apart from proper
                  compressive sensing sampling schemes, the recovery
                  from simultaneous simulations depends on a
                  sparsifying transform that compresses seismic data,
                  is fast, and reasonably incoherent with the
                  compressive-sampling matrix. Using the curvelet
                  transform, in which seismic data can be represented
                  parsimoniously, the recovery of the
                  sequential-source data volumes is achieved using the
                  sparsity-promoting program {\textemdash} SPGL1, a
                  solver based on projected spectral gradients. The
                  main outcome of this approach is a new technology
                  where acquisition related costs are no longer
                  determined by the stringent Nyquist sampling
                  criteria.},

  title = {Compressed computation of large-scale wavefield extrapolation in inhomogeneous medium},
  school = {University of British Columbia},
  year = {2008},
  type = {masters},
  abstract = {In this work an explicit algorithm for the extrapolation
                  of one-way wavefields is proposed which combines
                  recent developments in information theory and
                  theoretical signal processing with the physics of
                  wave propagation. Because of excessive memory
                  requirements, explicit formulations for wave
                  propagation have proven to be a challenge in 3-D. By
                  using ideas from
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}compressed
                  sensing{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright}, we are
                  able to formulate the (inverse) wavefield
                  extrapolation problem on small subsets of the data
                  volume, thereby reducing the size of the
                  operators. Compressed sensing entails a new paradigm
                  for signal recovery that provides conditions under
                  which signals can be recovered from incomplete
                  samplings by \emph{nonlinear} recovery methods that
                  promote sparsity of the to-be-recovered
                  signal. According to this theory, signals can
                  successfully be recovered when the measurement basis
                  is \emph{incoherent} with the representation in
                  which the wavefield is sparse. In this new approach,
                  the eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz operator are
                  recognized as a basis that is incoherent with
                  sparsity transforms that are known to compress
                  seismic wavefields. By casting the wavefield
                  extrapolation problem in this framework, wavefields
                  can successfully be extrapolated in the modal
                  domain, despite evanescent wave modes. The degree to
                  which the wavefield can be recovered depends on the
                  number of missing (evanescent) wave modes and on the
                  complexity of the wavefield. A proof of principle
                  for the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}compressed
                  sensing{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} method is
                  given for inverse wavefield extrapolation in
                  2-D. The results show that our method is stable, has
                  reduced dip limitations and handles evanescent waves
                  in inverse extrapolation.},

However the computation and the storage of omnidirectional subsurface extended image volumes are usually prohibitive.

In our work, we will consider a linear algebra approach to deal with the low-rank representation of extended image volumes with full offsets. We will never build entirely the resulting matrix but get only actions of it on well-chosen probing vectors, based on Low-Rank decomposition or randomized SVD. This representation allows us to have access to all the energy of the extended image volume matrix and still limits the storage of the information and the computational cost.},

  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Most conventional 3D time-lapse (or 4D) acquisitions are ocean-bottom cable (OBC) or ocean-bottom node (OBN) surveys since these surveys are relatively easy to replicate compared to towed-streamer surveys. To attain high degrees of repeatability, survey replicability and dense periodic sampling has become the norm for 4D surveys that renders this technology expensive. Conventional towed-streamer acquisitions suffer from limited illumination of subsurface due to narrow azimuth. Although, acquisition techniques such as multi-azimuth, wide-azimuth, rich-azimuth acquisition, etc., have been developed to illuminate the subsurface from all possible angles, these techniques can be prohibitively expensive for densely sampled surveys. This leads to uneven sampling, i.e., dense receiver and coarse source sampling or vice-versa, in order to make these acquisitions more affordable. Motivated by the design principles of Compressive Sensing (CS), we acquire economic, randomly subsampled (or compressive) and simultaneous towed-streamer time-lapse data without the need of replicating the surveys. We recover densely sampled time-lapse data on one and the same periodic grid by using a joint-recovery model (JRM) that exploits shared information among different time-lapse recordings, coupled with a computationally cheap and scalable rank-minimization technique. The acquisition is low cost since we have subsampled measurements (about 70% subsampled), simulated with a simultaneous long-offset acquisition configuration of two source vessels travelling across a survey area at random azimuths. We analyze the performance of our proposed compressive acquisition and subsequent recovery strategy by conducting a synthetic, at scale, seismic experiment on a 3D time-lapse model containing geological features such as channel systems, dipping and faulted beds, unconformities and a gas cloud. Our findings indicate that the insistence on replicability between surveys and the need for OBC/OBN 4D surveys can, perhaps, be relaxed. Moreover, this is a natural next step beyond the successful CS acquisition examples discussed during this session.},

  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Unlike conventional reservoirs, unconventional plays are not naturally viable for economical production of oil and gas. They require stimulation by injecting high-pressure fluid causing fractures in the rocks. These fractures make the medium more permeable, hence, the extraction of oil and gas becomes feasible. For drilling purposes and to prevent potentially hazardous situations, we need to have good knowledge of the location of these fractures. Also, we need to have good knowledge about how these fractures originated in time. Hydraulic fracturing changes stress in rocks, which results in the emission of microseismic waves. The opening of cracks due to high pressure fluid injection during hydraulic fracturing mainly causes this change in stress in the rocks. Therefore, microseismic events are mostly localized along these fractures and have finite energy along time. To accurately track the evolution of fractures in both space and time, we need to locate closely spaced microseismic events along these fractures activating at very small time intervals. A naive approach can be the back propagation of the observed data to find out a point in space and time where maximum focusing of back propagating energy occurs. This point corresponds to the location and origin time of a microseismic source. This approach, although simpler, suffers from low resolution and requires scanning of complete 4D volume (3D in space and 1D in time). Hence, this method can be challenging when there are multiple closely spaced microseismic sources originating at different times. We in this work propose a sparsity promotion based method that can locate closely spaced microseismic events, with spatial separation as low as within half a wavelength, activating at small time intervals. We simultaneously estimate the origin time of microseismic events by estimating their source time functions. Our method exploits the fact that microseismic events are localized in space and have finite energy. We use accelerated Linearized Bregman algorithm with a preconditioning operator to arrive at a computationally feasible scheme.},

In Marine data however, these applications rely on the success of a pre-imaging separation of primaries and multiples, which can be modeled as a multi-dimensional convolution between the vertical derivative of the surface-free Green’s function and the down-going receiver wavefield. Instead of imaging the primaries and multiples separately, we implement the LS-RTM of the total down-going wavefield by combining areal source injection and linearized Born modelling, where strong surface related multiples are generated from a strong density variation at the ocean bottom. The advantage including surface related multiples in LS-RTM is the extra illumination we obtain from these multiples without incurring additional computational costs related to carrying out multi-dimensional convolutions part of conventional multiple prediction procedures. Even though we are able to avert these computational costs, our approach shares the large costs of LS-RTM. We reduce these costs by combining randomized source subsampling with our sparsity-promoting imaging technology, which produces artifact-free, high-resolution images, with the surface-related multiples migrated properly.},

In this work, we propose to compress our dense data in hierarchical Tucker tensor format by exploiting the low-rank structure of the data in a transformed domain. Then, we devise on-the-fly common shot or receiver gather extraction directly via the highly compressed factors. In subsampling scenarios, by interpolating this novel tensor format, we can also reconstruct the shot or receiver gather on a per-query basis rather than expanding the data to its fully-sampled form. We demonstrate the effective performance of our proposed technique on 3D stochastic full-waveform inversion, which allows the stochastic algorithm to extract shot gathers as it requires them throughout the inversion process. Moreover, we finally show how to computational effectively generate the CIGs from this compressed low-rank tensor representation of the data with the help of fast simultaneous shot or receiver gather generation.},

  title = {Efficient approach for quantifying uncertainty of wavefield reconstruction inversion},
  booktitle = {SINBAD Fall consortium talks},  
  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Due to the noisy measurements, sparse observations,
                  uncertain forward models, and uncertain prior
                  parameter information, significant uncertainty
                  arises in the inverted velocity model of
                  full-waveform inversion. The uncertain velocity
                  model leads to the uncertainty in the correct
                  positions of events in the migrated images, which
                  subsequently influences the important
                  decision-makings in the oil and gas exploration and
                  production (E&P) business such as the drilling
                  decisions and economic evaluations. Therefore,
                  understanding the uncertainty in the inverted
                  velocity model is essential for the mitigation of
                  the E&P risks. A common approach to accounting for
                  uncertainty in seismic inverse problems like
                  full-waveform inversion is to describe the unknown
                  parameters in probabilistic by the Bayesian
                  inference. The Bayesian inference aims at
                  incorporating the information from the data,
                  physics, and one’s prior knowledge to formulate a
                  posterior distribution function to characterize the
                  statistical properties of the unknown
                  parameters. However, characterizing uncertainties
                  for the large-scale full-waveform inversion in
                  seismic exploration is prohibitively expensive since
                  it requires thousands of function evaluations to
                  sample the parameter space (e.g. via Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo sampling). Apart from this, the existing
                  methods of uncertainty quantification for
                  full-waveform inversion is through applying the
                  Bayesian inference to the standard method such as
                  the adjoint-state method with the assumption that no
                  uncertainty arises from the wave-equation. However,
                  the wave-equation may not be able to reflect all the
                  physics, hence, incorporating uncertainty from
                  wave-equation might benefit the quantification of
                  uncertainty. In this work, we propose to perform
                  uncertainty quantification using the recently
                  proposed wavefield reconstruction inversion
                  technique, which gives an appropriate framework to
                  tackle the uncertainty in wave-equation solve by
                  adding the misfit of the wave-equation to the
                  likelihood distribution and relaxing the
                  wave-equation constraint. Moreover, we propose a
                  computationally feasible approach to analyzing the
                  posterior distribution of the wavefield
                  reconstruction inversion method, which incorporates
                  a Gaussian distribution that approximates the
                  posterior distribution with an optimization-driven
                  Gaussian simulator to sample the Gaussian
                  distribution efficiently. Numerical examples show
                  that comparing to the McMC method, our approach is
                  able to produce comparable results with less
                  computational cost. This is joint work with Curt da

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion is challenging in complex
                  geological areas. Even when provided with an
                  accurate starting model, the inversion algorithms
                  often struggle to update the velocity
                  model. Contrary to other areas in applied
                  geophysics, including prior information in
                  full-waveform inversion is still relatively in its
                  infancy. In part this is due to the fact that
                  incorporating prior information that relates to
                  geological settings where strong discontinuities in
                  the velocity model dominate is difficult, because
                  these settings call for non-smooth
                  regularizations. We tackle this problem by including
                  constraints on the spatial variations and value
                  ranges of the inverted velocities, as opposed to
                  adding penalties to the objective as is more
                  customary in main stream geophysical inversion. By
                  demonstrating the lack of predictability of
                  edge-preserving inversion when the regularization is
                  in the form of an added penalty term, we advocate
                  the inclusion of constraints instead. Our examples
                  show that the latter lead to more predictable
                  results and to significant improvements in the

  abstract = {Seismic data collection is becoming challenging because
                  of increased demands for high-quality, long-offset
                  and wide-azimuth data. Leveraging ideas from CS, in
                  this work we establish a cost effective acquisition
                  and processing techniques, which are no longer
                  dominated by survey area size but by the sparsity of
                  seismic data volumes. In the first part of abstract,
                  we establish connections between random time
                  dithering and jittered sampling in
                  space. Specifically, we recover high-quality 5D
                  seismic data volumes from time-jittered marine
                  acquisition where the average inter-shot time is
                  significantly reduced, leading to cheaper surveys
                  due to fewer overlapping shots. The time-jittered
                  acquisition, in conjunction with the shot separation
                  by Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD)-free
                  factorization based rank-minimization approach,
                  allows us to recover high quality 5D seismic data
                  volumes. Results are illustrated for simulations of
                  simultaneous time-jittered continuous recording for
                  a 3D ocean-bottom cable survey, where we outperforms
                  existing techniques, by an order of magnitude
                  computational speedup and using 1/20th of the
                  memory, that use sparsity in transforms domains. The
                  second part of abstract focussed on leveraging
                  low-rank structure in seismic data to solve
                  extremely large data recovery (interpolation)
                  problems. We introduced a large–scale SVD-free
                  optimization framework that is robust with respect
                  to outliers and that uses information on the
                  support. We test the efficacy of the proposed
                  interpolation framework on a large-scale 5D seismic
                  data, generated from the geologically complex
                  synthetic 3D Compass velocity model, where 80\% of
                  the data has been removed. Our findings show that
                  major computational and memory gains are possible

                  algorithms that require dense long-offset

                  exponential growth in data volumes and prohibitive
                  demands on computational resources. In this work, we
                  propose a fast, resilient, and scalable
                  wave-equation based inversion methodology for both
                  the data and image-domain, which can handle
                  complicated wave physics. First we show that both

  abstract = {We extend some of our previous work on constrained
                  formulations of full-waveform inversion. Some
                  motivating examples illustrate why solving
                  constrained problems directly is a simpler approach
                  for solving non-linear inverse problems than
                  penalized problem formulations. So far we used
                  constraints which can be represented as convex sets,
                  for which most optimization theory is
                  developed. Some non-convex counterparts of convex
                  sets are introduced and examples show that the
                  algorithms developed for convex sets also work well
                  with non-convex sets. The motivation to also explore
                  non-convex sets, is that they sometimes translate
                  prior geological knowledge into mathematical
                  constraints in a more direct way. All presented

  abstract = {Microseismic waves generated by hydraulic fracturing are
                  used to locate the fractures created in the
                  reservoir. Most of the existing source collocation
                  methods have their limitations in terms of
                  resolution of very closely spaced microseismic
                  events. In this work we propose a method to
                  collocate microseismic events with high resolution
                  along with simultaneous estimation of source time
                  function. In the context of waves, the
                  finite-difference modelling operator acts as an
                  analysis operator for wavefields. This implies that
                  wavefields under the action of a finite-difference
                  modelling kernel can be focused to sources
                  generating these wavefields. We exploit this
                  property of wavefields to locate microseismic events
                  and estimate the source time function jointly. To
                  arrive at a computational feasible scheme, we use
                  the accelerated version of Linearized Bregman (LBR)
                  algorithm to solve the above mentioned problem. This

  abstract = {Compared to more mundane blind deconvolution problems,
                  blind deconvolution in seismic applications involves
                  a feedback mechanism related to the free surface.
                  The presence of this feedback mechanism gives us an
                  unique opportunity to remove ambiguities that have
                  plagued blind deconvolution for a long time. While
                  beneficial, this feedback by itself is insufficient
                  to remove the ambiguities even with L1
                  constraints. However, when paired with an L1/L2
                  constraint the feedback allows us to resolve the
                  scaling ambiguity under relatively mild
                  assumptions. Inspired by lifting approaches, we
                  propose to split the sparse signal into positive and
                  negative components and apply an \ell_1/\ell_2
                  constraint to the difference, thereby obtaining a
                  constraint that is easy to implement.  Numerical
                  experiments demonstrate robustness to the
                  initialization as well as to noise in the data.},

  abstract = {A framework is proposed for regularizing the waveform
                  inversion problem by projections onto intersections
                  of convex sets. Multiple pieces of prior information
                  about the geology are represented by multiple convex
                  sets, for example limits on the velocity or minimum
                  smoothness conditions on the model. The data-misfit
                  is then minimized, such that the estimated model is
                  always in the intersection of the convex
                  sets. Therefore, it is clear what properties the
                  estimated model will have at each iteration. This
                  approach does not require any quadratic penalties to
                  be used and thus avoids the known problems and
                  limitations of those types of penalties. It is shown
                  that by formulating waveform inversion as a
                  constrained problem, regularization ideas such as
                  Tikhonov regularization and gradient filtering can
                  be incorporated into one framework. The algorithm is
                  generally applicable, in the sense that it works
                  with any (differentiable) objective function and
                  does not require significant additional
                  computation. The method is demonstrated on the

                  reflectivities with the same source wavelet. No
                  assumptions are made about the location of the
                  support of either the wavelet or the sparse
                  signals. Minimizing the ratio of l1 and l2 norms has
                  been previously shown to promote sparsity in a
                  variety of applications including blind
                  deconvolution. Most existing implementations are
                  heuristic or require smoothing the l1/l2
                  penalty. Lifted versions of l1/l2 constraints have
                  also been proposed but are still challenging to
                  implement. Inspired by the lifting approach, we
                  propose to split the sparse signals into positive
                  and negative components and apply an l1/l2
                  constraint to the difference, thereby obtaining a
                  constraint that is easy to implement without
                  smoothing the l1 or l2 norms. We show that a method
                  of multipliers implementation of the resulting model
                  can recover source wavelets that are not necessarily
                  minimum phase and approximately reconstruct the
                  sparse reflectivities. It appears to be robust to
                  the initialization and to small amounts of noise in
                  the data. We also discuss extensions to the
                  Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (EPSI)
                  convolution model.},

                  reasons as well as ground surface
                  limitations. Operational conditions might result in
                  noisy traces or even gaps in coverage and irregular

  abstract = {In this presentation, we extend our previous work in
                  Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensor completion, which
                  uses an extremely efficient representation for
                  representing high-dimensional tensors exhibiting
                  low-rank structure, to handle subsampled tensors
                  with noisy entries. We consider a `low-noise' case,
                  so that the energies of the noise and the signal are
                  nearly indistinguishable, and a `high-noise' case,
                  in which the noise energy is now scaled to the
                  amplitude of the entire data volume. For the
                  low-noise case in particular, standard
                  trace-by-trace energy comparisons cannot distinguish
                  noise from signal. We examine the behaviour of noise
                  in terms of the singular values along different
                  matricizations of the data, i.e. reshaping of the
                  tensor along different dimensions. By interpreting
                  this effect in the context of tensor completion, we
                  demonstrate the inefficacy of denoising by this
                  method in the source-receiver domain. In light of
                  this observation, we transform the decimated, noisy
                  data in to the midpoint-offset domain, which
                  promotes low-rank behaviour in the signal and
                  high-rank behaviour in the noise. This distinction
                  between signal and noise allows low-rank
                  interpolation to effectively denoise the signal,
                  without knowledge of the noise location, with only a
                  marginal increase in computational cost. We

                  full-waveform inversion that combines the best of
                  full-space constrained methods and reduced-space
                  unconstrained methods. Instead of eliminating the
                  constraint, which leads to the reduced adjoint-state
                  method that underpins most formulations of
                  full-waveform inversion, our method relaxes the PDE
                  constraint by replacing it by an additive
                  (least-squares) penalty term. By using the method of
                  variable projection, we arrive at a formulation that
                  alternates between solving for the wavefield, given
                  the velocity model & data, and solving for
                  velocity-model updates, given the wavefields. We
                  named this method Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion
                  (WRI) because it inverts for the model updates by
                  reconstructing the wavefield everywhere given data

                  techniques has been recently introduced in the

  abstract = {For many full-waveform inversion techniques, the most
                  computationally intensive step is the computation of
                  a numerical solution for the wave equation on every
                  iteration. In the frequency domain approach, this
                  requires the solution of very large, complex,
                  sparse, ill-conditioned linear systems. In this
                  abstract we bring out attention specifically to CGMN
                  method for solving PDEs, known for being flexible
                  (i.e. it is able to treat equally acoustic data as
                  well as visco-elastic or more complex scenarios)
                  efficient with respect both to memory and
                  computation time, and controllable accuracy of the
                  final approximation. We propose an improvement for
                  the known CGMN method by imposing a minimal residual
                  condition, which incurs in one extra model vector
                  storage. The resulting algorithm called CRMN enjoys
                  several interesting properties as monotonically
                  nonincreasing behaviour of the norm of the residual
                  and minimal residual, guaranteeing optimal
                  convergence for the relative residual criterion. We
                  discuss numerical experiments both in an isolated
                  PDE solve and also within the inversion procedure,
                  showing that in a realistic scenario we can expect a
                  speedup around 25\% when using CRMN rather than
                  CGMN. Joint work with Art Petrenko, Zhilong Fang,

  organization = {SINBAD},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {In this talk I consider the problem of inverting
                  waveforms for multiple medium parameters. The
                  governing PDE is chosen to be the Helmholtz equation
                  with compressibility and buoyancy as the
                  unknowns. Both unknowns occur in the same equation
                  and practice has shown it is very hard to estimate
                  both equally accurate; the buoyancy estimate (or
                  density if a slightly different parametrization is
                  used) is typically much smoother than the
                  compressibility (or velocity). Here I introduce a
                  new waveform inversion algorithm: a full Newton-type
                  method based on a penalty method which adds the PDE
                  constraint as a quadratic penalty term. This method
                  updates both the 'wavefields' and medium parameters,
                  without explicitly solving PDE's. One of the main
                  advantages is the availability of a sparse Hessian
                  and exact gradient which are not the result of any
                  PDE solves. We asses if the availability of the
                  Hessian, which includes information about the
                  coupling between the two medium parameters, can help
                  reconstruct both compressibility and buoyancy.},

  abstract = {An implementation of seismic wave simulation on a
                  platform consisting of a conventional host processor
                  and a reconfigurable hardware accelerator is
                  presented. This research is important in the field
                  of exploration for oil and gas resources, where a 3D
                  model of the subsurface is frequently required. By
                  comparing seismic data collected in a real-world
                  survey with synthetic data generated by simulated
                  waves, it is possible to deduce such a
                  model. However this requires many time-consuming
                  simulations with different Earth models to find the
                  one that best fits the measured data. Speeding up
                  the wave simulations would allow more models to be
                  tried, yielding a more accurate estimate of the
                  subsurface. The reconfigurable hardware accelerator
                  employed in this work is a field programmable gate
                  array (FPGA). FPGAs are computer chips that consist
                  of electronic building blocks that the user can
                  configure and reconfigure to represent their
                  algorithm in hardware. Whereas a traditional
                  processor can be viewed as a pipeline for processing
                  instructions, an FPGA is a pipeline for processing
                  data. The chief advantage of the FPGA is that all
                  the instructions in the algorithm are already
                  hardwired onto the chip. This means that execution
                  time depends only on the amount of data to be
                  processed, and not on the complexity of the
                  algorithm. The main contribution is an
                  implementation of the well-known Kaczmarz row
                  projection algorithm on the FPGA, using techniques
                  of dataflow programming. This kernel is used as the
                  preconditioning step of CGMN, a modified version of
                  the conjugate gradients method that is used to solve
                  the time-harmonic acoustic isotropic constant
                  density wave equation. Using one FPGA accelerator,
                  the current implementation allows seismic wave
                  simulations to be performed over twice as fast,
                  compared to running on one Intel Xeon E5-2670
                  core. I also discuss the effect of modifications of
                  the algorithm necessitated by the hardware on the
                  convergence properties of CGMN. Finally, a specific
                  plan for future work is set-out in order to fully
                  exploit the accelerator platform, and my work is set
                  in its larger context},

                  approach will suffer from the detrimental effects of
                  cycle skipping if the starting model is
                  inaccurate. We reformulate FWI so that it instead
                  adapts the predicted data to the observed data using
                  Wiener filters, and then iterates to improve the
                  model by forcing the Wiener filters towards zero-lag
                  delta functions. This adaptive FWI scheme is
                  demonstrated on synthetic data where it is shown to
                  be immune to cycle skipping, and is able to invert
                  successfully data for which conventional FWI fails
                  entirely. The new method does not require low
                  frequencies or a highly accurate starting model to
                  be successful. Adaptive FWI has some features in
                  common with wave-equation migration velocity
                  analysis, but it works for all types of arrivals

                  mitigate some of the non-linearity inherent in

                  that the wave-equation needs to be solved
                  exactly. The basic workflow of this new method is as
                  follows; i) solve an overdetermined wave-equation
                  (the data-augmented wave-equation), where the data
                  serves as additional constraints for the wavefields,
                  ii) compute the wavefield-residual by substituting
                  this wavefield in the wave-equation, and iii)
                  correlate the wavefield with the wavefield-residual
                  to obtain a model-update. As opposed to the
                  conventional workflow, no explicit adjoint solve is
                  needed to compute the model-update. However, instead

  abstract = {Solution of the Helmholtz equation is the main
                  computational burden of full-waveform inversion in
                  the frequency domain. For this task we employ the
                  CARP-CG algorithm (Gordon & Gordon 2010), an
                  iterative solver that preconditions the original
                  Helmholtz system into an equivalent symmetric
                  positive definite system and then applies the method
                  of conjugate gradients. Forming the matrix for the
                  new system is not necessary as its multiplicative
                  action on a vector is implemented using a series of
                  projections onto the rows of the original
                  system. Our contribution is implementing CARP-CG for
                  a host + accelerator (FPGA) computing
                  environment. The computational paradigm is one of
                  dataflow: vector and matrix elements are streamed
                  from memory through the accelerator which applies
                  the row projections. The advantage of an FPGA to
                  process streams of data is that unless the algorithm
                  is memory bandwidth limited, computation time is
                  directly proportional to the amount of data. The
                  complexity of the algorithm implemented on the FPGA
                  is irrelevant since all the operations programmed
                  onto the FPGA happen in the same clock tick. In
                  contrast, on a CPU, more complex algorithms require
                  more clock ticks as the instructions are executed
                  sequentially, or with only a small amount of
                  parallelism. Ongoing work porting the CARP-CG
                  algorithm to the accelerator is presented.},

                  proposed to fit a subset of the data's

                  recovery from simultaneous data, as a compressed
                  sensing problem. In this work we will show how we
                  can borrow the same ideas of compressed sensing and
                  cast these problems as matrix completion
                  problems. Instead of sparsity we will show that we
                  can exploit the low-rank structure of seismic data
                  to solve these problems. One of the impediments in
                  rank-minimization problem is the computation of
                  singular values. We will also show how we can solve
                  the rank minimization problems SVD-free. The
                  practical application is divided into three parts:
                  1. In case of sequential seismic data acquisition,
                  how jittered subsampling helps to recover the better
                  quality data as compared to random
                  subsampling. 2. How the incorporation of reciprocity
                  principles help to enhance the quality of recovered
                  fully sampled data. 3. How we can recover the

                  recovery performance when we have prior information
                  about the support, i.e., the indices of the non-zero
                  entries, of the signal to be recovered. First we
                  briefly review the results of "weighted $\ell_p$
                  minimization algorithm with p = 1 and 0 < p <

                  support information into the AMP algorithm. We
                  empirically show that this algorithm recovers sparse

                  problems that occur in (geophysical) inversion
                  problems. The method takes measured data from a
                  physical system as input and minimizes an objective
                  function that depends on an unknown model for the
                  physical parameters, fields, and additional nuisance
                  parameters such as the source function. The
                  invention consists of a minimization procedure
                  involving a cost functional comprising of a
                  data-misfit term and a penalty term that measures
                  how accurately the fields satisfy the PDE. The

                  the solution of a system of equations forming the

                  initial estimates for the physical model
                  parameters. Contrary to the reduced formulation, the
                  proposed method does not require the solution of an
                  adjoint PDE, effectively halving the number of PDE
                  solves and memory requirement. As in the reduced
                  formulation, fields can be computed independently
                  and aggregated, possibly in parallel.},

                  high-dimensional tensors exhibiting particular
                  low-rank structure. With some minor alterations to
                  existing theoretical developments, we develop an
                  optimization framework based on the geometric
                  understanding of HT tensors as a smooth manifold, a
                  generalization of smooth curves/surfaces. Building
                  on the existing research of solving optimization
                  problems on smooth manifolds, we develop Steepest
                  Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods for HT
                  tensors. The resulting algorithms converge quickly,
                  are immediately parallelizable, and do not require
                  the computation of SVDs. We also derive efficient
                  Gauss-Newton based algorithms which converge much
                  faster than standard, first-order methods. We also
                  extend ideas about favourable sampling conditions
                  for missing-data recovery from the field of Matrix
                  Completion to Tensor Completion and demonstrate how
                  the organization of data can affect the success of
                  recovery. As a result, if one has data with randomly
                  missing source pairs, using these ideas, coupled
                  with an efficient solver, one can interpolate
                  large-scale seismic data volumes with missing
                  sources and/or receivers by exploiting the
                  multidimensional dependencies in the data. We are
                  able to recover data volumes amidst extremely high
                  subsampling ratios (in some cases, > 75\%) using this
                  approach and we demonstrate our recovery on a

  abstract = {Wave-equation based inversions, such as full-waveform
                  inversion, are challenging because of their
                  computational costs, memory requirements, and
                  reliance on accurate initial models. To confront
                  these issues, we propose a novel formulation of
                  full-waveform inversion based on a penalty
                  method. In this formulation, the objective function
                  consists of a data-misfit term and a penalty term
                  which measures how accurately the wavefields satisfy
                  the wave-equation. Because we carry out the
                  inversion over a larger search space, including both
                  the model and synthetic wavefields, our approach
                  suffers less from local minima. Our main
                  contribution is the development of an efficient
                  optimization scheme that avoids having to store and
                  update the wavefields by explicit
                  elimination. Compared to existing optimization
                  strategies for full-waveform inversion, our method
                  differers in two main aspects; i. The wavefields are
                  solved from an augmented wave-equation, where the
                  solution is forced to solve the wave-equation and
                  fit the observed data, ii. no adjoint wavefields are
                  required to update the model, which leads to
                  significant computational savings. We demonstrate
                  the validity of our approach by carefully selected
                  examples and discuss possible extensions and future
                  research. This is joint work with Tristan van

                  important tool for migration-velocity and
                  amplitude-versus-angle analysis in areas of complex
                  geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of
                  as multidimensional correlations of the source and
                  receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing the
                  gathers lies in the fact that one needs to store and
                  compute these wavefields and in correlating the
                  wavefields to obtain the desired image
                  gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically
                  only computed for a limited number of subsurface
                  points and for a limited range of subsurface
                  offsets. In this presentation, we offer a new
                  perspective on such gathers by organizing the
                  extended image as a function of all subsurface
                  offsets for all subsurface points in a matrix whose
                  (i,j) entry captures the interaction between
                  gridpoints i and j. Of course, it is infeasible to
                  form and store this matrix. Instead, we propose an
                  efficient algorithm to glean information from the
                  image volume via the action of matrix-vector
                  products with this matrix. We illustrate how this
                  can be used to (i) form conventional image gathers
                  and construct objective functions for automated MVA
                  and (ii) calculate true two-way wave-equation angle
                  gathers that allow us to carry out linearized
                  angle-versus-offset inversion with geologic-dip

  abstract = {Recent developments in matrix rank optimization have
                  allowed for new computational approaches in the
                  field of seismic data interpolation.  One of the
                  main requirements of exploiting rank-minimization
                  approaches is that the target data set should
                  exhibit a low-rank structure. Seismic frequency
                  slices exhibit low-rank structure at the
                  low-frequencies, but not at the high
                  frequencies. This behavior is due to the increase in
                  oscillations as we move from low to high-frequency
                  slices, even though the energy remains focused
                  around the diagonal. Therefore, interpolation via
                  rank minimization in the high-frequency range
                  requires extended formulations that incorporate
                  low-rank structure. We propose an approach for
                  seismic data interpolation which incorporates the
                  Hierarchical Semi-Separable Structure (HSS) inside
                  rank-regularized least-squares formulations for the
                  missing-trace interpolation problem. The proposed
                  approach is suitable for large scale problems, since
                  it avoids SVD computations and uses a low-rank
                  factorized formulation instead. We illustrate the
                  advantages of the new HSS approach by interpolating
                  a seismic line from the Gulf of Suez and compare the
                  reconstruction with conventional rank minimization.},

  abstract = {Over the years we have investigated seismic data
                  interpolation and redatuming algorithms rely on on
                  the assumption that seismic records and images
                  permit sparse approximations under certain
                  representations, such as Curvelet
                  coefficients. Recent findings have suggested that
                  for redundant representations (of which Curvelet is
                  an example), the analysis operator that maps the
                  physical signal to coefficients may also play a
                  crucial role in recovering data from incomplete
                  observations. This insight elevates the significance
                  of a question that often goes unaddressed: is it
                  better for the transform-domain sparsity to be
                  achieved through explicit construction of sparse
                  representations (e.g., by thresholding of small
                  transform-domain coefficients), or by demanding that
                  the algorithm return physical signals which produces
                  sparse coefficients when hit with the forward
                  transform? Recent results show that the two
                  approaches give rise to different solutions when the
                  transform is redundant, and that the latter approach
                  imposes a whole new class of constraints. In
                  particular, the number of zero-valued coefficients
                  given by the analysis operator acting on the signal,
                  referred to as its "cosparsity", have an analogous
                  role to the sparsity of the signal in terms of the
                  coefficients. From this framework, a new
                  reconstruction algorithm is proposed which may allow
                  better reconstruction from subsampled signaled than
                  what the sparsity assumption alone would predict. In
                  this work we apply the new framework and algorithm
                  to the case of seismic data interpolation under the
                  curvelet domain, and show that it admits better
                  reconstruction than some existing L1 sparsity-based
                  methods derived from compressive sensing for a range
                  of subsampling factors. We will also investigate
                  different analysis operators and their impact on
                  both sparsity and cosparsity-based algorithms.},

  abstract = {Seismic surveys amass large and incomplete data
                  sets, and designing algorithms to interpolate the
                  missing data at very large scales poses a daunting
                  and critical challenge.  We study how to apply
                  scalable matrix completion methods to such
                  interpolation problems.  Recent studies in matrix
                  completion have shown that a matrix that has low
                  rank can be exactly completed when only a small
                  number of observations are available. However, there
                  are two challenges to applying matrix completion to
                  seismic data. Matrix completion is typically applied
                  to two dimensional or dyadic data whereas seismic
                  data is often tensorial. Also successful matrix
                  completion requires a low-rank matrix structure. We
                  address these problems by organizing the seismic
                  data on a matrix grid which exhibits a low-rank
                  structure. This encoding allows us to apply the
                  Jellyfish algorithm, developed at the University of
                  Wisconsin, which achieves state-of-the-art
                  performance for large-scale matrix completion. The
                  proposed framework makes it possible to complete

                  data in minutes on standard multicore

  abstract = {There has been a swell of research in the scientific
                  computing community in the last couple of years
                  which tries to extend notions of linear algebra
                  (rank, the SVD, linear systems, etc.) to higher
                  dimensional arrays, or tensors. Much work has been
                  proposed to try to overcome the so called "curse of
                  dimensionality", the O(N^d) storage required for a
                  d-dimensional array, where N is the size of each
                  dimension. The hierarchical Tucker format is one
                  such tensor representation which manages to
                  decompose a hierarchy of dimensions into parameter
                  matrices of very manageable size, requiring at most
                  dNK + (d - 2)K^3 + K^2 parameters, where K is an
                  internal rank parameter. In this work, we extend
                  ideas of matrix completion to the tensor case, where
                  we only know a small number of randomly distributed
                  entries from various 4D frequency slices, and try to

                  because the size of seismic data volumes is

                  will reveal velocity errors by de-focusing and can

                  optimal sensitivity to velocity errors, the

                  forming the extended image for subsurface offsets in

                  frequently with the broad application of compressed
                  sensing tool in exploration seismology. Because of
                  the curse of dimensionality, the prohibitive
                  computation burden on iteratively evaluating
                  objective functions is one of the key issues that
                  constrain high performance l1 solver. In this paper,
                  we try to further improve the convergence
                  performance of SPGl1, one of the state-of-the-art
                  large scale sparse recovery solver, and as a result
                  limit the number of objective function evaluations
                  by introducing a projected quasi Newton

                  the correct subsurface locations. However, simply
                  applying the cross-correlation imaging condition
                  will introduce non-causal artifacts into the final
                  image. Here we propose an inversion approach to
                  image primaries and multiples simultaneously that
                  yields an artifact-free image. To address the high
                  computational cost associated with inversion, we
                  propose to: i) have the wave-equation solver carry
                  out the multi-dimensional convolutions implicitly,
                  and ii) reduce the number of PDE solves by
                  randomized subsampling. We then propose to improve
                  the overall performance of this algorithm by a
                  process called rerandomization, which helps to
                  cancel the correlation built between model iterate
                  and the subsampling operator. We show the merits of

                  must be placed at the exact location as they were,
                  during baseline survey and acquisition. This
                  condition is required to be able to produce an image
                  of the same location over time and this enhances a
                  proper reservoir characterization. The cost of
                  repeating the seismic acquisition is very expensive,

                  ingredient in seismic full waveform inversion
                  (FWI). Simulation in the time domain and solution of
                  the wave equation in the frequency domain are two
                  competing approaches to modelling. Frequency domain
                  approaches can further be categorized as using
                  either direct or iterative solvers. For 3D FWI,
                  iterative solvers in the frequency domain are
                  attractive, partly because they require less memory
                  than the other methods. This is due to the fact that
                  there is no need to store the wavefield at each time
                  step, or compute a factorization of the Helmholtz
                  operator that will not be as sparse as the original
                  matrix. One iterative solver that has been applied
                  to the Helmholtz equation is CARP-CG. CARP-CG uses
                  Kaczmarz row projections for each block of a domain
                  decomposition scheme to precondition the Helmholtz
                  system into being symmetric and positive

  abstract = {We have implemented a robust and practical scheme for
                  anisotropic 3D acoustic full-waveform inversion. We
                  demonstrate this scheme on a field data set,
                  applying it to a four-component ocean-bottom survey
                  over the Tommeliten Alpha field in the North
                  Sea. This shallow-water data set provides good
                  azimuthal coverage to offsets of 7 km, with reduced
                  coverage to a maximum offset of about 11 km. The
                  reservoir lies at the crest of a high-velocity
                  antiformal chalk section, overlain by about 3000 m
                  of clastics within which a low-velocity gas cloud
                  produces a seismic obscured area. We inverted only
                  the hydrophone data, and we retained free-surface
                  multiples and ghosts within the field data. We
                  invert in six narrow frequency bands, in the range 3
                  to 6.5 Hz. At each iteration, we selected only a
                  subset of sources, using a different subset at each
                  iteration; this strategy is more efficient than
                  inverting all the data every iteration. Our starting
                  velocity model was obtained using standard PSDM
                  model building including anisotropic reflection
                  tomography, and contained epsilon values as high as
                  20\%. We have also attempted full-elastic inversion
                  of these data to recover a shallow isotropic model
                  of both p and s-wave velocities. The final FWI
                  velocity model shows a network of shallow
                  high-velocity channels that match similar features
                  in the reflection data. Deeper in the section, the
                  FWI velocity model reveals a sharper and
                  more-intense low-velocity region associated with the
                  gas cloud in which low-velocity fingers match the
                  location of gas-filled faults visible in the
                  reflection data. The resulting velocity model
                  provides a better match to well logs, and better
                  flattens common image gathers, than does the
                  starting model. Reverse-time migration, using the
                  FWI velocity model, provides significant uplift to
                  the migrated image, simplifying the planform of the
                  reservoir section at depth. The workflows, inversion
                  strategy, and algorithms that we have used have
                  broad application to invert a wide-range of

                  updating the initial velocity model, we expect the
                  final model can reveal subsurface structure till the
                  wavefield misfit can converge to designed tolerance.
                  The conventional FWI approach is expensive since it
                  requires the inversion of a linear system, which
                  involves extremely large multi-experiment data
                  volumes. To overcome this issue we percent a
                  curvetlet based sparsity-promoting Gauss-Newton
                  inversion method. In this presentation we invert for
                  the model updates by replacing the normal
                  Gauss-Newton linearized subproblem for subsampled

                  speed up the algorithm and avoid over fitting the

                  gradually increasing grid size as we move to higher
                  frequencies. Our approach is successful because it
                  reduces the size of seismic data volumes without
                  loss of information. With this reduction, we can
                  compute a Newton-like update with the reduced data
                  volume at the cost of roughly one gradient update
                  for the fully sampled wavefield.},

  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {Conventional oil and gas fields are increasingly difficult to explore and im- age, resulting in a call for more complex wave-equation based inversion al- gorithms that require dense long-o↵set samplings. Consequently, there is an exponential growth in the size of data volumes and prohibitive demands on computational resources. In this work, we propose a method to com- press and process seismic data directly in a low-rank tensor format, which drastically reduces the amount of storage required to represent the data. We first outline how seismic data exhibits low-rank structure in a particular transform-domain, which can be exploited to compress the dense data in one extremely storage-efficient tensor format when the data is fully sampled. In the more realistic case of missing data, we can use interpolation techniques based on the same tensor format to recover fully sampled data volume in compressed form. In either case, once we have our data represented in its compressed tensor form, we design an algorithm to extract source or receiver gathers directly from the compressed parameters. This extraction process can be done on-the-fly directly on the compressed data, in the full wave- form inversion context, and does not require scanning through the entire dataset in order to form shot gathers. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first major contributions to working with seismic data applications directly in the compressed domain without reconstructing the entire data volume. We use a stochastic inversion approach, which works with small subsets of source experiments at each iteration, further to reduce the computational and memory costs of full waveform inversion. We also demonstrate how this data compression and extraction technique can be ap- plied to forming full subsurface image gathers through probing techniques.},

                  and random natural processes. Exploration
                  geophysicists use a combination of assumptions,
                  approximate physical models, and trained pattern
                  recognition to extract useful information from
                  complex remote sensing data such as seismic and well
                  logs. In this thesis I investigate supervised and
                  unsupervised machine learning models in geophysical
                  data analysis and present two novel applications to
                  exploration geophysics. Firstly, interpreted well
                  logs from the Trenton-Black River study are used to
                  train a classifier that results in a success rate of
                  67\% at predicting stratigraphic units from gamma
                  ray logs. I use the scattering transform, a
                  multiscale analysis transform, to extract
                  discriminating features to feed a K-nearest
                  neighbour classifier. A second experiment frames a
                  conventional pre-stack seismic data characterization
                  workflow as an unsupervised machine learning problem
                  that is free from physical
                  assumptions. Conventionally, the Shuey model is used
                  to fit the angle dependent reflectivity response of
                  seismic data. I instead use principle component
                  based approaches to learn projections from the data
                  that improve classification. Results on the Marmousi
                  II elastic model and an industry field dataset show
                  that unsupervised learning models can be effective
                  at segmenting hydrocarbon reservoirs from seismic

  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {The synthesis model for signal recovery has been the
                  model of choice for many years in compressive
                  sensing. Various weighting schemes using prior
                  support information to adjust the objective function
                  associated with the synthesis model have been shown
                  to improve the recovery of the signal in terms of
                  accuracy. Generally, even with no prior knowledge of
                  the support, iterative methods can build support
                  estimates and incorporate that into the recovery
                  which has also been shown to increase the speed and
                  accuracy of the recovery. However when the original
                  signal is sparse with respect to a redundant
                  dictionary (rather than an orthonormal basis) there
                  is a counterpart model to synthesis, namely the
                  analysis model, which has been less popular but has
                  recently attracted more attention. The analysis
                  model is much less understood and thus there are
                  fewer theorems available in both the context of
                  non-weighted and weighted signal recovery. In this
                  thesis, we investigate weighting in both the
                  analysis model and synthesis model in weighted
                  $\ell_1$-minimization. Theoretical guarantees on
                  reconstruction and various weighting strategies for
                  each model are discussed. We give conditions for
                  weighted synthesis recovery with frames which do not
                  require strict incoherency conditions, this is based
                  on recent results of regular synthesis with frames
                  using optimal dual $\ell_1$ analysis. A novel
                  weighting technique is introduced in the analysis
                  case which outperforms its traditional counterparts
                  in the case of seismic wavefield reconstruction. We
                  also introduce a weighted split Bregman algorithm
                  for analysis and optimal dual analysis. We then
                  investigate these techniques on seismic data and
                  synthetically created test data using a variety of
                  frames.},

  year = {2014},

  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {An implementation of seismic wave simulation on a
                  platform consisting of a conventional host processor
                  and a reconfigurable hardware accelerator is
                  presented. This research is important in the field
                  of exploration for oil and gas resources, where a 3D
                  model of the subsurface of the Earth is frequently
                  required. By comparing seismic data collected in a
                  real-world survey with synthetic data generated by
                  simulated waves, it is possible to deduce such a
                  model. However this requires many time-consuming
                  simulations with different Earth models to find the
                  one that best fits the measured data. Speeding up
                  the wave simulations would allow more models to be
                  tried, yielding a more accurate estimate of the
                  subsurface. The reconfigurable hardware accelerator
                  employed in this work is a field programmable gate
                  array (FPGA). FPGAs are computer chips that consist
                  of electronic building blocks that the user can
                  configure and reconfigure to represent their
                  algorithm in hardware. Whereas a traditional
                  processor can be viewed as a pipeline for processing
                  instructions, an FPGA is a pipeline for processing
                  data. The chief advantage of the FPGA is that all
                  the instructions in the algorithm are already
                  hardwired onto the chip. This means that execution
                  time depends only on the amount of data to be
                  processed, and not on the complexity of the
                  algorithm. The main contribution is an
                  implementation of the well-known Kaczmarz row
                  projection algorithm on the FPGA, using techniques
                  of dataflow programming. This kernel is used as the
                  preconditioning step of CGMN, a modified version of
                  the conjugate gradients method that is used to solve
                  the time-harmonic acoustic isotropic constant
                  density wave equation. Using one FPGA-based
                  accelerator, the current implementation allows
                  seismic wave simulations to be performed over twice
                  as fast, compared to running on one Intel Xeon
                  E5-2670 core. I also discuss the effect of
                  modifications of the algorithm necessitated by the
                  hardware on the convergence properties of CGMN.
                  Finally, a specific plan for future work is set-out
                  in order to fully exploit the accelerator platform,
                  and the work is set in its larger context.},

  abstract = {Compressed sensing is a data acquisition technique that
                  entails recovering estimates of sparse and

                  significantly fewer than the signal ambient
                  dimension $N$. In this thesis we show how we can
                  reduce the required number of measurements even
                  further if we incorporate prior information about
                  the signal into the reconstruction
                  algorithm. Specifically, we study certain weighted
                  nonconvex $\ell_p$ minimization algorithms and a
                  weighted approximate message passing algorithm. In
                  Chapter 1 we describe compressed sensing as a
                  practicable signal acquisition method in application
                  and introduce the generic sparse approximation
                  problem. Then we review some of the algorithms used
                  in compressed sensing literature and briefly
                  introduce the method we used to incorporate prior
                  support information into these problems. In Chapter
                  2 we derive sufficient conditions for stable and
                  robust recovery using weighted $\ell_p$ minimization
                  and show that these conditions are better than those

                  experiments, both on synthetic examples and on
                  audio, and seismic signals. In Chapter 3 we derive
                  weighted AMP algorithm which iteratively solves the
                  weighted $\ell_1$ minimization. We also introduce a
                  reweighting scheme for weighted AMP algorithms which
                  enhances the recovery performance of weighted
                  AMP. We also apply these algorithms on synthetic

  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {The primary focus of most reflection seismic surveys is
                  to help locate hydrocarbon recourses. Due to an ever
                  increasing scarcity of these recourses, we must
                  increase the size and quality of our seismic
                  surveys. However, processing such large seismic data
                  volumes to accurately recover earth properties is a
                  painstaking and computationally intensive
                  process. Due to the way reflection seismic surveys
                  are conducted there are often holes in the collected
                  data, where traces are not recorded. This can be due
                  to physical or cost constraints. For some of the
                  initial stages of processing these missing traces
                  are of little consequence. However processes like
                  multiple prediction and removal, interferometric
                  ground roll prediction, and migration require
                  densely sampled data on a regular grid. Thus the
                  need to interpolate undersampled data cannot be
                  ignored. Using the fact that reflection seismic data
                  sets obey a reciprocal relationship in source and
                  receiver locations, combined with recent advances in
                  the field of compressed sensing, we show that
                  properly regularized the wavefield reconstruction
                  problem can be solved with a high degree of
                  accuracy. We exploit the compressible nature of
                  seismic data in the curvelet domain to solve
                  regularized l1 recovery problems that seek to match
                  the measured data and enforce the above mentioned
                  reciprocity. Using our method we were able to

  abstract = {The process of obtaining high quality seismic images is
                  very challenging when exploring new areas that have
                  high complexities. The to be processed seismic data
                  comes from the field noisy and commonly incomplete.
                  Recently, major advances were accomplished in the
                  area of coherent noise removal, for example, Surface
                  Related Multiple Elimination (SRME). Predictive
                  multiple elimination methods, such as SRME, consist
                  of two steps: The first step is the prediction step,
                  in this step multiples are predicted from the
                  seismic data. The second step is the separation step
                  in which primary reflection and surface related
                  multiples are separated, this involves predicted
                  multiples from the first step to be matched with the
                  true multiples in the data and eventually removed. A
                  recent robust Bayesian wavefield separation method
                  have been recently introduced to improve on the
                  separation by matching methods. This method utilizes
                  the effectiveness of using the multi scale and multi
                  angular curvelet transform in processing seismic
                  images. The method produced excellent results and
                  improved multiple removal. A considerable problem in
                  the seismic processing field is the fact that
                  seismic data are large and require a correspondingly
                  large memory size and processing time. The fact that
                  curvelets are redundant also increases the need for
                  large memory to process seismic data. In this thesis
                  we propose a parallel approach based windowing
                  operator that divides large seismic data into
                  smaller more managable datasets that can fit in
                  memory so that it is possible to apply the Bayesian
                  separation process in parallel with minimal harm to
                  the image quality and data integrity. However, by
                  dividing the data, we introduce discontinuities. We
                  take these discontinuities into account and compare
                  two ways that different windows may communicate.
                  The first method is to communicate edge information
                  at only two steps, namely, data scattering and
                  gathering processes while applying the multiple
                  separation on each window separately. The second
                  method is to define our windowing operator as a
                  global operator, which exchanges window edge
                  information at each forward and inverse curvelet
                  transform.  We discuss the trade off between the two
                  methods trying to minimize complexity and I/O time
                  spent in the process. We test our windowing operator
                  on a seismic denoising problem and then apply the
                  windowing operator on our sparse-domain Bayesian
                  primary-multiple separation.},

  abstract = {Data-driven methods—such as the estimation of primaries
                  by sparse inversion suffer from the curse of
                  dimensionality that leads to disproportional growth
                  in computational and storage demands when moving to
                  realistic 3D field data. To remove this fundamental
                  impediment, we propose a dimensionality-reduction
                  technique where the data matrix is approximated
                  adaptively by a randomized low-rank
                  factorization. Compared to conventional methods,
                  which need passes through all the data possibly
                  including on-the-fly interpolations for each
                  iteration, our approach has the advantage that the
                  passes is reduced to one to three. In addition, the
                  low-rank matrix factorization leads to considerable
                  reductions in storage and computational costs of the
                  matrix multiplies required by the sparse
                  inversion. Application of the proposed formalism to
                  synthetic and real data shows that significant
                  performance improvements in speed and memory use are
                  achievable at a low computational overhead required
                  by the low-rank factorization.},

  abstract = {A recent robust multiple-elimination technique, based on
                  the underlying principle that relates primary
                  impulse response to total upgoing wavefield, tries
                  to change the paradigm that sees surface-related
                  multiples as noise that needs to be removed from the
                  data prior to imaging. This technique, estimation of
                  primaries by sparse inversion (EPSI), (van
                  Groenestijn and Verschuur, 2009; Lin and Herrmann,
                  2009), proposes an inversion procedure during which
                  the source function and surface- free impulse
                  response are directly calculated from the upgoing
                  wavefield using an alternating optimization
                  procedure. EPSI hinges on a delicate interplay
                  between surface-related multiples and pri-
                  maries. Finite aperture and other imperfections may
                  violate this relationship. In this thesis, we
                  investigate how to make EPSI more robust by
                  incorporating curvelet-domain matching in its
                  formulation. Compared to surface-related multiple
                  removal (SRME), where curvelet-domain matching was
                  used successfully, incorporating this step has the
                  additional advantage that matches multiples to
                  multiples rather than predicated multiples to total
                  data as in SRME.},

  abstract = {We consider seismic signals as a superposition of
                  waveforms parameterized by their fractional-
                  orders. Each waveform models the reflection of a
                  seismic wave at a particular transition between two
                  lithological layers in the subsurface. The location
                  of the waveforms in the seismic signal corresponds
                  to the depth of the transitions in the subsurface,
                  whereas their fractional-order constitutes a measure
                  of the sharpness of the transitions. By considering
                  fractional-order transitions, we generalize the
                  zero-order transition model of the conventional
                  deconvolution problem, and aim at capturing the
                  different types of transitions. The goal is to
                  delineate and characterize transitions from seismic
                  signals by recovering the locations and
                  fractional-orders of its corresponding
                  waveforms. This problem has received increasing
                  interest, and several methods have been proposed,
                  including multi- and monoscale analysis based on
                  Mallat{\textquoteright}s wavelet transform modulus
                  maxima, and seismic atomic decomposition. We propose
                  a new method based on a two-step approach, which
                  divides the initial problem of delineating and
                  characterizing transitions over the whole seismic
                  signal, into two easier sub-problems. The algorithm
                  first partitions the seismic signal into its major
                  components, and then estimates the fractional-orders
                  and locations of each component. Both steps are
                  based on the sparse decomposition of seismic signals
                  in overcomplete dictionaries of waveforms parameter-
                  ized by their fractional-orders, and involve
                  $\ell_1$ minimizations solved by an iterative
                  thresholding algorithm. We present the method and

                  seismic signal separation in the presence of noise
                  and with the production of artifacts and reflector

                  reflector information while improving the surface
                  wave removal. The abstract contains a separate real

                  for the wave-equation and its adjoint. The main
                  computational cost of a wave-equation solver is to
                  compute the Laplacian, or more complex
                  finite-difference operators, at every time step. The
                  performance of many discretizations is limited by
                  the relatively low operational intensity (number of
                  floating point operations divided by memory traffic)
                  of the finite-difference stencil. Solving the
                  wave-equation for multiple sources/right-hand-sides
                  (RHSs) at once mitigates this problem by increasing
                  the operational intensity. This is implemented by
                  rewriting the classical matrix-vector product into a
                  matrix-matrix product where each column of the
                  second matrix represent the solution wavefield for
                  each given source. This minor modification to the
                  solver is shown to achieve a 2-4 times speedup

                  in this paper on acoustic modelling, but our
                  approach can easily be extended to anisotropic or

                  prior knowledge of the generally unknown source
                  wavelet. We address these problems by introducing an
                  algorithm for low-cost sparsity-promoting
                  least-squares migration with source estimation. We
                  adapt a recent algorithm from sparse optimization,
                  which allows to work with randomized subsets of
                  shots during each iteration of least-squares
                  migration, while still converging to an
                  artifact-free solution. We modify the algorithm to
                  incorporate on-the-fly source estimation through
                  variable projection, which lets us estimate the
                  wavelet without additional PDE solves. The algorithm
                  is easy to implement and allows imaging at a
                  fraction of the cost of conventional least squares
                  reverse-time migration, requiring only around two
                  passes trough the data, making the method feasible
                  for large-scale imaging problems with unknown source
                  wavelets.},

  abstract = {Numerical solvers for the wave equation are a key
                  component of Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) and
                  Reverse-Time Migration (RTM). The main computational
                  cost of a wave-equation solver stems from the
                  computation of the Laplacian at each time step. When
                  using a finite difference discretization this can be
                  characterized as a structured grid computation
                  within Colella's Seven Dwarfs. Independent of the
                  degree of parallelization the performance will be
                  limited by the relatively low operational intensity
                  (number of operations divided by memory traffic) of
                  finite-difference stencils, that is so say that the
                  method is memory bandwidth bound. For this reason
                  many developers have focused on porting their code
                  to platforms that have higher memory bandwidth, such
                  as GPU's, or put significant effort into highly
                  intrusive optimisations. However, these
                  optimisations rarely strike the right performance vs
                  productivity balance as the software becomes less
                  maintainable and extensible. By solving the wave
                  equation for multiple sources/right-hand-sides
                  (RHSs) at once, we overcome this problem arriving at
                  a time-stepping solver with higher operational
                  intensity. In essence, we arrive at this result by
                  turning the usual matrix-vector products into a
                  matrix-matrix products where the first matrix
                  implements the discretized wave equation and each
                  column of the second matrix contain separate
                  wavefields for each given source. By making this
                  relatively minor change to the solver we readily
                  achieved a $\times{2}$ speedup. While we limit
                  ourselves to acoustic modeling, our approach can
                  easily be extended to the anisotropic or elastic
                  cases.},

                  primary reflections are used to form image gathers
                  as multiples can cause artifacts that interfere with
                  the events of interest. However, it has been shown
                  that multiples can actually provide extra
                  illumination of the subsurface, especially for
                  delineating the near-surface features. In this
                  paper, we aim to form common image gathers directly
                  from the data with surface related multiples by
                  applying concepts that have been used to
                  successfully deal with surface-related multiples in

                  extended images with better near-surface
                  illumination that are free of artifacts that can

                  of the DNOISE series of projects can be simply
                  summarized as: ``How to image more deeply and with
                  more detail?" and ``How to do more with less data?"
                  Also, to help overcome the current substantial
                  challenges in the oil and gas industry, we maintain
                  this focus with more specific follow-up questions
                  such as: ``How can we control costs and remove
                  acquisition-related artifacts in 3D (time-lapse)

                  wave-equation based inversion, control computational
                  costs, assess uncertainties, extract reservoir

  institution = {UBC},
  year = {2014},

  number = {TR-EOAS-2014-9},
  abstract = {Least-squares seismic migration (LSM) is a wave equation based linearized inversion problem relying on the minimization of a least-squares misfit function, with respect to the medium perturbation, between recorded and modeled wavefields. Today’s challenges in Hydrocarbon ex- ploration are to build high resolution images of more and more complicated geological reservoirs, which requires to handle very large systems of equations. The extreme size of the problem com- bined with the fact that it is ill-conditioned make LSM not yet feasible for industrial purposes. To overcome this "curse of dimensionality", dimension reduction and divide-and-conquer tech- niques that aim to decrease the computation time and the required memory, while conserving the image quality, have recently been developed. By borrowing ideas from stochastic optimiza- tion and compressive sensing, the imaging problem is reformulated as an L1-regularized, sparsity promoted LSM. The idea is to take advantage of the compressibility of the model perturbation in the curvelet domain and to work on series of smaller subproblems each involving a small ran- domized subset of data. We try two different subset sampling strategies, artificial randomized simultaneous sources experiments ("supershots") and drawing sequential shots firing at random source locations. These subsets are changed after each subproblem is solved. In both cases we obtain good migration results at significantly reduced computational cost. Application of these methods to a complicated synthetic model yields to encouraging results, underlining the usefulness of sparsity promotion and randomization in time stepping formulation.

                  chain Monte Carlo (McMC) method to quantify the

                  formulate the uncertainty quantification problem in
                  the framework of the Bayesian inference, which
                  formulates the posterior probability as the
                  conditional probability of the model given the
                  observed data. The Metropolis-Hasting algorithm is
                  used to generate samples satisfying the posterior
                  probability density function (pdf) to quantify the
                  uncertainty. However it suffers from the challenge
                  to construct a proposal distribution that
                  simultaneously provides a good representation of the
                  true posterior pdf and is easy to manipulate. To
                  address this challenge, we propose a stochastic
                  quasi-Newton McMC method, which relies on the fact
                  that the Hessian of the deterministic problem is
                  equivalent to the inverse of the covariance matrix
                  of the posterior pdf. The l-BFGS (limited-memory
                  Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) Hessian is used to
                  approximate the inverse of the covariance matrix
                  efficiently, and the randomized source sub-sampling
                  strategy is used to reduce the computational cost of
                  evaluating the posterior pdf and constructing the
                  l-BFGS Hessian. Numerical experiments show the
                  capability of this stochastic quasi-Newton McMC
                  method to quantify the uncertainty of FWI with a
                  considerable low cost.},

                  techniques has been recently introduced in the
                  seismic community. All the existing
                  rank-minimization techniques assume the recording
                  locations to be on a regular grid, e.g. sampled
                  periodically, but seismic data are typically
                  irregularly sampled along spatial axes. Other than
                  the irregularity of the sampled grid, we often have
                  missing data. In this paper, we study the effect of
                  grid irregularity to conduct matrix completion on a
                  regular grid for unstructured data. We propose an

  institution = {UBC},
  abstract = {As we entered the second half of the DNOISE II project,
                  we are happy to report that we have made significant
                  progress on several fronts. Firstly, our work on
                  seismic data acquisition with compressive sensing is
                  becoming widely recognized. For instance,
                  ConocoPhilips ran a highly successful field trial on
                  Marine acquisition with compressive sensing and
                  obtained significant improvements compared to
                  standard production (see figure below). Moreover,
                  one of the main outcomes of this year’s EAGE
                  workshop was that industry is ready to adapt
                  randomized sampling as a new acquisition
                  paradigm. Needless to say this is a big success for
                  what we have been trying to accomplish with DNOISE
                  II. Finally, we have made a breakthrough in the
                  application of randomized sampling in 4-D seismic,
                  which is receiving a lot of interest from
                  industry. Secondly, our work on large-scale
                  optimization in the context of wave-equation based
                  inversion is also increasingly widely adapted. For
                  instance, our batching techniques are making the
                  difference between making a loss or profit for a
                  large contractor company active in the area of
                  full-waveform inversion. We also continued to make
                  progress in exciting new directions that go beyond
                  sparsity promotion and which allow us to exploit
                  other types of structure within the data, such as
                  low-rank for matrices or hierarchical Tucker formats
                  for tensors. Application of these techniques show
                  excellent results and in certain cases, such as
                  source separation problems with small dithering,
                  show significant improvements over transform-domain
                  methods. Thirdly, we continued to make significant
                  progress in wave-equation based inversion. We
                  extended our new penalty-based formulation now
                  called Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion/Imaging to
                  include total-variation regularization and density
                  variations. We also continued to make progress on
                  multiples, imaging with multiples and 3-D
                  full-waveform inversion. Statoil is the latest
                  company to join and we have several other companies
                  that have shown a keen interest. We also received
                  substantial in-kind contributions including a
                  license to WesternGeco’s iOmega and HPC equipment
                  discounts. After many years of support BP decided
                  unfortunately to no longer support SINBAD quoting
                  financial headwind related to the Deep horizon
                  disaster. On a more positive note, we are extremely
                  happy to report major progress on our efforts to
                  secure access to high-performance compute, including
                  renewed funding from NSERC and our involvement in
                  the International Inversion Initiative in Brazil. 9
                  peer-reviewed journal publications have resulted
                  from our work within the reporting period, with a
                  further 6 submitted, and DNOISE members disseminated
                  the results of our research at 49 major national and
                  international conference presentations. On the HQP
                  training side, 4 MSc students have recently
                  graduated, with one obtaining a position with CGG
                  Calgary, and we added 4 postdocs and 3 PhD students
                  to our team in September 2014, greatly increasing
                  our research capacity. As can be seen from the
                  report below, we are well on schedule and on certain
                  topics well beyond the milestones included in the
                  original proposal. With the purchase of the new
                  cluster we expect to see a surge of activity in
                  extending our algorithms to 3D. With this increased
                  capacity, we continue to be in an excellent position
                  to make fundamental contributions to the fields of
                  seismic data acquisition, processing, and
                  wave-equation based inversion. In the sections
                  below, we give a detailed overview of the research
                  and publication activities of the different members
                  of the group and how these relate to the objectives

                  a small subset of the data, yielding a few PDE
                  solves for the inversion. In this abstract, we are
                  aiming at addressing the issue of accuracy of model
                  parameters by inverting density and velocity
                  simultaneously rather than only using velocity. As a
                  matter of face, the effects of density and velocity
                  variations towards the wavefield are very similar,
                  which will cause energy leakage between density and
                  velocity images. To overcome this issue, we proposed
                  a incoherence enhanced method that can reduce the
                  similarity between the effect of density and
                  velocity. Moreover, the location of structural
                  variations in velocity and density are often
                  overlapped in geological setting, thus in this
                  abstract, we also exploit this property with
                  joint-sparsity promoting to further improve the
                  imaging result.},

  abstract = {In time-lapse or 4D seismics, repeatability of the
                  acquisition is a very crucial step, as we do not
                  want spurious events that are not there. In this
                  paper, we propose an approach which avoids any
                  requirement to repeat the surveys, by using
                  randomized sampling technique which allows us to be
                  more efficient in the acquisition. Our method
                  applies to sampling data using ocean bottom nodes
                  (OBN) as receivers. We test the efficacy of our
                  proposed randomized acquisition geometry for
                  time-lapse survey on two different models. In the
                  first example, model properties does not change with
                  time, while in the second example, model exhibit a
                  time-lapse effect which may be caused by the
                  migration of fluid within the reservoir. We perform
                  two types of randomized sampling - uniform
                  randomized sampling and jittered sampling to
                  visualize the effects of non-repeatability in
                  time-lapse survey. We observe that jittered
                  randomized sampling is a more efficient method
                  compared to randomized sampling, due to it's
                  requirement to control the maximum spacing between
                  the receivers. The results are presented, in the
                  image space, as a least-squares migration of the

                  are happy to report that we have made significant
                  progress on several fronts. Firstly, our work on
                  seismic data acquisition with compressive sensing is
                  becoming widely recognized, reflected in adaptations
                  of this technology by industry and in this year’s
                  SEG Karcher award, which went to Gilles Hennenfent,
                  who was one of the researchers who started working
                  in this area in our group. As this report shows, we
                  continued to make progress on this topic with
                  numerous presentations, publications, and software
                  releases. Secondly, our work on large-scale
                  optimization is also widely adapted and instrumental
                  to the different research areas on the grant. In
                  particular, we are excited about new directions that
                  go beyond sparsity promotion and which allow us to
                  exploit other types of structure within the data,
                  such as low-rank. Over the near future, we expect to
                  see a body of new research based on these findings
                  touching acquisition as well as the wave-equation
                  based inversion aspects of our research
                  program. Thirdly, we are also very happy to report
                  that we continued to make substantial progress in
                  wave-equation base inversion. In particular, we
                  would like to mention successes in the areas of
                  acceleration of sparsity-promoting imaging with
                  source estimation and multiples and in theoretical
                  as well as practical aspects of full-waveform
                  inversion. We derived a highly practical and
                  economic formulation of 3-D FWI and we also came up
                  with a complete new formulation of FWI, which
                  mitigates issues related to cycle skipping. Finally,
                  we made a lot of progress applying our algorithm to
                  industrial datasets, which has been well received by
                  industry. Our findings show that FWI is still an
                  immature technology calling for more theoretical
                  input and for the development of practical
                  workflows. Over the last year our work cumulated in
                  14 peer-reviewed journal publications, 5 submitted
                  journal publications, 13 (+ 9) extended abstracts,
                  32 talks at international conferences, and 6
                  software packages. Finally, we are happy to report
                  that we have been joined by several new companies,
                  namely, ION Geophysical, CGG, and Woodside. At this
                  midpoint of the Grant, we are also happy to report
                  that we are well on schedule to meet the milestones
                  included in the original proposal. Given our wide
                  range of expertise and our plans to replace our
                  compute cluster, we continue to be in an excellent
                  position to make fundamental contributions to the
                  fields of seismic data acquisition, processing, and
                  wave-equation based inversion.},

                  a large search-space (consisting of both control and
                  state variables) while allowing for an efficient
                  implementation that avoids storing and updating the
                  state-variables. This leads to a method that has
                  roughly the same per-iteration complexity as
                  conventional reduced approaches while dening an
                  objective that is less non-linear in the control
                  variable by implicitly relaxing the constraint. We
                  apply the method to a seismic inverse problem where
                  it leads to a particularly ecient implementation
                  when compared to a conventional reduced approach as
                  it avoids the use of adjoint
                  state-variables. Numerical examples illustrate the
                  approach and suggest that the proposed formulation
                  can indeed mitigate some of the well-known problems
                  with local minima in the seismic inverse problem.},

                  typical size of the problems in 3D applications
                  precludes the use of direct factorization to solve

  abstract = {In this paper, we offer an alternative sampling method
                  leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing
                  towards seismic acquisition and processing for data
                  that are traditionally considered to be
                  undersampled. The main outcome of this approach is a
                  new technology where acquisition and processing
                  related costs are no longer determined by overly
                  stringent sampling criteria, such as Nyquist. At the
                  heart of our approach lies randomized incoherent
                  sampling that breaks subsampling related
                  interferences by turning them into harmless noise,
                  which we subsequently remove by promoting
                  transform-domain sparsity. Now, costs no longer grow
                  with resolution and dimensionality of the survey
                  area, but instead depend on transform-domain
                  sparsity only. Our contribution is twofold. First,
                  we demonstrate by means of carefully designed
                  numerical experiments that compressive sensing can
                  successfully be adapted to seismic
                  acquisition. Second, we show that accurate recovery
                  can be accomplished for compressively sampled data
                  volumes sizes that exceed the size of conventional
                  transform-domain data volumes by only a small
                  factor. Because compressive sensing combines
                  transformation and encoding by a single linear
                  encoding step, this technology is directly
                  applicable to acquisition and to dimensionality
                  reduction during processing. In either case,
                  sampling, storage, and processing costs scale with
                  transform-domain sparsity.},

  abstract = {The tasks of sampling, compression and reconstruction
                  are very common and often necessary in seismic data
                  processing due to the large size of seismic
                  data. Curvelet-based Recovery by Sparsity-promoting
                  Inversion, motivated by the newly developed theory
                  of compressive sensing, is among the best recovery
                  strategies for seismic data. The incomplete data
                  input to this curvelet-based recovery is determined
                  by randomized sampling of the original complete
                  data. Unlike usual regular undersampling, randomized
                  sampling can convert aliases to easy-to-eliminate
                  noise, thus facilitating the process of
                  reconstruction of the complete data from the
                  incomplete data. Randomized sampling methods such as
                  jittered sampling have been developed in the past
                  that are suitable for curvelet-based recovery,
                  however most have only been applied to sampling in
                  one dimension. Considering that seismic datasets are
                  usually higher dimensional and extremely large, in
                  the present paper, we extend the 1D version of
                  jittered sampling to two dimensions, both with
                  underlying Cartesian and hexagonal grids. We also
                  study separable and non-separable two dimensional
                  jittered sampling, the former referring to the
                  Kronecker product of two one-dimensional jittered
                  samplings. These different categories of jittered
                  sampling are compared against one another in terms
                  of signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality, from
                  which we find that jittered hexagonal sampling is
                  better than jittered Cartesian sampling, while fully
                  non-separable jittered sampling is better than
                  separable sampling. Because in the image processing
                  and computer graphics literature, sampling patterns
                  with blue-noise spectra are found to be ideal to
                  avoid aliasing, we also introduce two other
                  randomized sampling methods, possessing sampling
                  spectra with beneficial blue noise characteristics,
                  Poisson Disk sampling and Farthest Point
                  sampling. We compare these methods, and apply the
                  introduced sampling methodologies to higher
                  dimensional curvelet-based reconstruction. These
                  sampling schemes are shown to lead to better results
                  from CRSI compared to the other more traditional
                  sampling protocols, e.g. regular subsampling.},

                  competing aims. These curves are commonly used in
                  problems with two-norm priors where they are plotted
                  on a log-log scale and are known as L-curves. For

  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Imaging in geological challenging environments has led to new developments, including the idea of generating reflection responses by means of interferometric redatuming at a given target datum in the subsurface, when the target datum lies beneath a complex overburden. One way to perform this redatuming is via conventional model-based wave-equation techniques. But those techniques can be computationally expensive for large-scale seismic
problems since the number of wave-equation solves is equal to two-times the number of
sources involved during seismic data acquisition. Also conventional shot-profile
techniques require lots of memory to save full subsurface extended image volumes. Therefore,
they only form subsurface image volumes in either horizontal or vertical directions. We now present a
randomized singular value decomposition based approach built upon the matrix
probing scheme, which takes advantage of the algebraic structure of the extended
imaging system. This low-rank representation enables us to overcome both the computational
cost associated with the number of wave-equation solutions and memory usage due to explicit
storage of full subsurface extended image volumes employed by conventional migration
methods. Experimental results on complex geological models demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed methodology and allow practical reflection-based extended imaging for large-scale 5D seismic data.},

  title = {Projection methods for nonlinear inverse problems with multiple constraints},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Nonlinear inverse problems are often hampered by non-uniqueness and local minima because of missing low frequencies and far offsets in the data, lack of access to good starting models, noise, and modeling errors. A well-known approach to counter these deficiencies is to include prior information on the unknown model, which regularizes the inverse problem. While conventional regularization methods have resulted in enormous progress in ill-posed (geophysical) inverse problems, challenges remain when the prior information consists of multiple pieces. To handle this situation, we propose an optimization framework that allows us to add multiple pieces of prior information in the form of constraints. Compared to additive regularization penalties, constraints have a number of advantages making them more suitable for inverse problems such as full-waveform inversion. The proposed framework is rigorous because it offers assurances that multiple constraints are imposed uniquely at each iteration, irrespective of the order in which they are invoked. To project onto the intersection of multiple sets uniquely, we employ Dykstra’s algorithm that scales to large problems and does not rely on trade-off parameters. In that sense, our approach differs substantially from approaches such as Tikhonov regularization, penalty methods, and gradient filtering. None of these offer assurances, which makes them less suitable to full-waveform inversion where unrealistic intermediate results effectively derail the iterative inversion process. By working with intersections of sets, we keep expensive objective and gradient calculations unaltered, separate from projections, and we also avoid trade-off parameters. These features allow for easy integration into existing code bases. In addition to more predictable behavior, working with constraints also allows for heuristics where we built up the complexity of the model gradually by relaxing the constraints. This strategy helps to avoid convergence to local minima that represent unrealistic models. We illustrate this unique feature with examples of varying complexity.},

While so-called back propagation or time-reversal methods are able to focus recorded energy back onto the sources when a reasonable velocity model is available, these methods suffer from blurring especially in situations where the data acquisition suffers from lack of aperture, sparse sampling, and noise. As a result, these methods typically cannot resolve sources in close proximity, a desired feature since we need this information if we want to follow the fracture evolution in space and time. In that situation, we need to estimate the locations and the associated source-time functions for closely spaced microseismic sources along the active fractures. To overcome the limitations of time-reversal methods, we propose a wave-equation based inversion approach where we invert for the complete source wavefield in both space and time. By promoting sparsity on the source wavefield in space, we negate the effects of non-radiating sources during the inversion and obtain high-resolution intensity plots and high-fidelity estimates for the source-time functions. We obtain these results relatively fast by accelerating the linearized Bregman method with a dual formulation. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method is computationally feasible, robust to noise, and works for closely spaced sources with overlapping source-time functions in complex geological settings.},

  title = {Applications of low-rank compressed seismic data to full waveform inversion and extended image volumes},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = { Conventional oil and gas fields are increasingly difficult to explore and image, resulting in the call for more complex wave-equation based inversion algorithms that require dense long-offset samplings. Consequently, there is an exponential growth in the size of data volumes and prohibitive demands on computational resources. In this work, we propose a method to compress and process seismic data directly in a low-rank tensor format, which drastically reduces the amount of storage required to represent the data. We first outline how seismic data exhibits low-rank structure in a particular transform-domain, which can be exploited to compress the dense data in one extremely storage-efficient tensor format when the data is fully sampled. In the more realistic case of missing data, we can use efficient interpolation techniques to approximate the fully sampled volume in compressed form. In either case, once we have our data represented in its compressed tensor form, we design an algorithm to extract source or receiver gathers directly from the compressed parameters. This extraction process can be done on-the-fly directly on the compressed data, in a full waveform inversion context, and does not require scanning through the entire dataset in order to form shot gathers. To the best of our knowledge, this work is one of the first major contributions to working with seismic data applications directly in the compressed domain without reconstructing the entire data volume. We use a stochastic inversion approach, which works with small subsets of source experiments at each iteration, further reducing the computational and memory costs of full waveform inversion. We also demonstrate how this data compression and extraction technique can be applied to forming full subsurface image gathers through probing techniques.},

  title = {A large-scale framework for symbolic implementations of seismic inversion algorithms in Julia},
  year = {2018},
  abstract = {Writing software packages for seismic inversion is a very challenging task, since problems such as full-waveform inversion or least-squares imaging are both algorithmically and computationally demanding due to the large number of unknown parameters and the fact that we are propagating waves over many wavelengths. Software frameworks therefore need to combine both versatility and performance to provide geophysicists with the means and flexibility to implement complex algorithms that scale to exceedingly large 3D problems. Following these principles, we introduce the Julia Devito Inversion framework, an open-source software package in Julia for large-scale seismic modeling and inversion based on Devito, a domain-specific language compiler for automatic code generation. The framework consists of matrix-free linear operators for implementing seismic inversion algorithms that closely resembles the mathematical notation, a flexible resilient parallelization and an interface to Devito for generating optimized stencil code to solve the underlying wave equations. In comparison to many manually optimized industry codes written in low-level languages, our software is built on the idea of independent layers of abstractions and user interfaces with symbolic operators, making it possible to manage both the complexity of algorithms and performance optimizations, while preserving modularity, which allows for a level of expressiveness needed to formulate a broad range of wave-equation-based inversion problems. Through a series of numerical examples, we demonstrate that this allows users to implement algorithms for waveform inversion and imaging as simple Julia scripts that scale to large-scale 3D problems; thus providing a truly performant research and production framework.},

{PDE}-constraints},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = { In a statistical inverse problem, the objective is a complete
              statistical description of unknown parameters from noisy observations in order to quantify uncertainties of the parameters of interest. We consider inverse problems with partial-differential-equation-constraints, which are applicable to
              a variety of seismic problems. Bayesian inference is one of the most widely-used approaches to precisely quantify statistics through a posterior distribution, incorporating uncertainties in observed data, modeling kernel, and prior knowledge of the parameters. Typically when formulating the posterior distribution, the partial-differential-equation-constraints are required to be exactly satisfied, resulting in a highly nonlinear forward map and a posterior distribution with many local maxima. These drawbacks make it difficult to find an appropriate approximation for the posterior distribution. Another complicating factor is that traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are known to converge slowly for realistically sized problems. In this work, we relax the partial-differential-equation-constraints by introducing an auxiliary variable, which allows for Gaussian deviations in the partial-differential-equations. Thus, we obtain a new bilinear posterior distribution consisting of both data and partial-differential-equation misfit terms. We illustrate that for a particular range of variance choices for the partial-differential-equation misfit term, the new posterior distribution has fewer modes and can be well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution, which can then be sampled in a straightforward manner. Since it is prohibitively expensive to explicitly construct the dense covariance matrix of the Gaussian approximation for intermediate to large-scale problems, we present a method to implicitly construct it, which enables efficient sampling. We apply this framework to two-dimensional seismic inverse problems with 1,800 and 92,455 unknown parameters. The results illustrate that our framework can produce comparable statistical quantities to those produced by conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo type methods while requiring far fewer partial-differential-equation solves, which are the main computational bottlenecks in these problems.},

  title = {Source estimation for wavefield-reconstruction inversion},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Source estimation is essential to all the wave-equation-based seismic inversions, including full-waveform inversion and the recently proposed wavefield-reconstruction inversion. When the source estimation is inaccurate, errors will propagate into the predicted data and introduce additional data misfit. As a consequence, inversion results that minimize this data misfit may become erroneous. To mitigate the errors introduced by the incorrect and pre-estimated sources, an embedded procedure that updates sources along with medium parameters is necessary for the inversion. So far, such a procedure is still missing in the context of wavefield-reconstruction inversion, a method that is, in many situations, less prone to local minima related to the so-called cycle skipping, compared to full-waveform inversion through exact data-fitting. While wavefield-reconstruction inversion indeed helps to mitigate issues related to cycle skipping by extending the search space with wavefields as auxiliary variables, it relies on having access to the correct source functions. In this paper, we remove the requirement of having the accurate source functions by proposing a source estimation technique specifically designed for wavefield-reconstruction inversion. To achieve this task, we consider the source functions as unknown variables and arrive at an objective function that depends on the medium parameters, wavefields, and source functions. During each iteration, we apply the so-called variable projection method to simultaneously project out the source functions and wavefields. After the projection, we obtain a reduced objective function that only depends on the medium parameters and invert for the unknown medium parameters by minimizing this reduced objective. Numerical experiments illustrate that this approach can produce accurate estimates of the unknown medium parameters without any prior information of the source functions.},

                  ocean-bottom cable (OBC) or ocean-bottom node (OBN)
                  surveys since these surveys are relatively easy to
                  replicate compared to towed-streamer surveys. To
                  attain high degrees of repeatability, survey
                  replicability and dense periodic sampling has become
                  the norm for 4D surveys that renders this technology
                  expensive. Conventional towed-streamer acquisitions
                  suffer from limited illumination of subsurface due
                  to narrow azimuth. Although, acquisition techniques
                  such as multi-azimuth, wide-azimuth, rich-azimuth
                  acquisition, etc., have been developed to illuminate
                  the subsurface from all possible angles, these
                  techniques can be prohibitively expensive for
                  densely sampled surveys. This leads to uneven
                  sampling, i.e., dense receiver and coarse source
                  sampling or vice-versa, in order to make these
                  acquisitions more affordable. Motivated by the
                  design principles of Compressive Sensing (CS), we
                  acquire economic, randomly subsampled (or
                  compressive) and simultaneous towed-streamer
                  time-lapse data without the need of replicating the
                  surveys. We recover densely sampled time-lapse data
                  on one and the same periodic grid by using a
                  joint-recovery model (JRM) that exploits shared
                  information among different time-lapse recordings,
                  coupled with a computationally cheap and scalable
                  rank-minimization technique. The acquisition is low
                  cost since we have subsampled measurements (about
                  70\% subsampled), simulated with a simultaneous
                  long-offset acquisition configuration of two source
                  vessels travelling across a survey area at random
                  azimuths. We analyze the performance of our proposed
                  compressive acquisition and subsequent recovery
                  strategy by conducting a synthetic, at scale,
                  seismic experiment on a 3D time-lapse model
                  containing geological features such as channel
                  systems, dipping and faulted beds, unconformities
                  and a gas cloud. Our findings indicate that the
                  insistence on replicability between surveys and the
                  need for OBC/OBN 4D surveys can, perhaps, be
                  relaxed. Moreover, this is a natural next step

                  high fidelity, highly repeatable, dense prestack
                  vintages, and high-grade time-lapse. To arrive at
                  this result, we assumed well-calibrated
                  surveys---i.e., we presumed accurate post-plot
                  source/receiver positions. Unfortunately, in
                  practice seismic surveys are prone to calibration
                  errors, which are unknown deviations between actual
                  and post-plot acquisition geometry. By means of
                  synthetic experiments, we analyze the possible
                  impact of these errors on vintages and on time-lapse
                  data obtained with our joint recovery model from

                  impact of calibration errors on conventional dense
                  but irregularly sampled surveys and on low-cost
                  compressed surveys. To separate time-lapse effects
                  from calibration issues, we consider the idealized
                  case where the subsurface remains unchanged and the
                  practical situation where time-lapse changes are
                  restricted to a subset of the data. In both cases,
                  the quality of the recovered vintages and time-lapse
                  decreases gracefully for low-cost compressed surveys
                  with increasing calibration errors. Conversely, the

  abstract = {The life-cycle of a partial differential equation (PDE)
                  solver is often characterized by three development
                  phases: the development of a stable numerical
                  discretization; development of a correct (verified)
                  implementation; and the optimization of the
                  implementation for different computer
                  architectures. Often it is only after significant
                  time and effort has been invested that the
                  performance bottlenecks of a PDE solver are fully
                  understood, and the precise details varies between
                  different computer architectures. One way to
                  mitigate this issue is to establish a reliable
                  performance model that allows a numerical analyst to
                  make reliable predictions of how well a numerical
                  method would perform on a given computer
                  architecture, before embarking upon potentially long
                  and expensive implementation and optimization
                  phases. The availability of a reliable performance
                  model also saves developer effort as it both informs
                  the developer on what kind of optimisations are
                  beneficial, and when the maximum expected
                  performance has been reached and optimisation work
                  should stop. We show how discretization of a
                  wave-equation can be theoretically studied to
                  understand the performance limitations of the method
                  on modern computer architectures. We focus on the
                  roofline model, now broadly used in the
                  high-performance computing community, which
                  considers the achievable performance in terms of the
                  peak memory bandwidth and peak floating point
                  performance of a computer with respect to
                  algorithmic choices. A first principles analysis of
                  operational intensity for key time-stepping
                  finite-difference algorithms is presented. With this
                  information available at the time of algorithm
                  design, the expected performance on target computer
                  systems can be used as a driver for algorithm
                  design. },

  abstract = {Time-lapse seismic is a powerful technology for
                  monitoring a variety of subsurface changes due to
                  reservoir fluid flow. However, the practice can be
                  technically challenging when one seeks to acquire
                  colocated time-lapse surveys with high degrees of
                  replicability among the shot locations. We have
                  determined that under "ideal" circumstances, in
                  which we ignore errors related to taking
                  measurements off the grid, high-quality prestack
                  data can be obtained from randomized subsampled
                  measurements that are observed from surveys in which
                  we choose not to revisit the same randomly
                  subsampled on-the-grid shot locations. Our
                  acquisition is low cost because our measurements are
                  subsampled. We have found that the recovered finely
                  sampled prestack baseline and monitor data actually
                  improve significantly when the same on-the-grid shot
                  locations are not revisited. We achieve this result
                  by using the fact that different time-lapse data
                  share information and that nonreplicated
                  (on-the-grid) acquisitions can add information when
                  prestack data are recovered jointly. Whenever the
                  time-lapse data exhibit joint structure---i.e., they
                  are compressible in some transform domain and share
                  information---sparsity-promoting recovery of the
                  "common component" and "innovations," with respect
                  to this common component, outperforms independent
                  recovery of the prestack baseline and monitor
                  data. The recovered time-lapse data are of high
                  enough quality to serve as the input to extract
                  poststack attributes used to compute time-lapse
                  differences. Without joint recovery, artifacts---due
                  to the randomized subsampling---lead to
                  deterioration of the degree of repeatability of the
                  time-lapse data. We tested this method by carrying
                  out experiments with reliable statistics from
                  thousands of repeated experiments. We also confirmed
                  that high degrees of repeatability are achievable
                  for an ocean-bottom cable survey acquired with
                  time-jittered continuous recording.},

                  geologic areas. Even when provided with an accurate
                  starting model, the inversion algorithms often
                  struggle to update the velocity model. Compared with
                  other areas in applied geophysics, including prior
                  information in full-waveform inversion is still in
                  its relative infancy. In part, this is due to the
                  fact that it is difficult to incorporate prior
                  information that relates to geologic settings where
                  strong discontinuities in the velocity model
                  dominate, because these settings call for nonsmooth
                  regularizations. We tackle this problem by including
                  constraints on the spatial variations and value
                  ranges of the inverted velocities, as opposed to
                  adding penalties to the objective, which is more
                  customary in mainstream geophysical inversion. By
                  demonstrating the lack of predictability of
                  edge-preserving inversion when the regularization is
                  in the form of an added penalty term, we advocate
                  the inclusion of constraints instead. Our examples
                  show that the latter leads to more predictable
                  results and to significant improvements in the
                  delineation of salt bodies when these constraints
                  are relaxed gradually in combination with extending
                  the search space to approximately fit the observed
                  data but not the noise.},

                  and receivers is inevitable in field seismic
                  acquisitions. Consequently, time-lapse surveys
                  become particularly expensive since current
                  practices aim to replicate densely sampled surveys
                  for monitoring changes occurring in the reservoir
                  due to hydrocarbon production. We demonstrate that
                  under certain circumstances, high-quality prestack
                  data can be obtained from cheap randomized
                  subsampled measurements that are observed from
                  nonreplicated surveys. We extend our time-jittered
                  marine acquisition to time-lapse surveys by
                  designing acquisition on irregular spatial grids
                  that render simultaneous, subsampled and irregular
                  measurements. Using the fact that different
                  time-lapse data share information and that
                  nonreplicated surveys add information when prestack
                  data are recovered jointly, we recover periodic
                  densely sampled and colocated prestack data by
                  adapting the recovery method to incorporate a
                  regularization operator that maps traces from an
                  irregular spatial grid to a regular periodic
                  grid. The recovery method is, therefore, a combined
                  operation of regularization, interpolation
                  (estimating missing fine-grid traces from subsampled
                  coarse-grid data), and source separation (unraveling
                  overlapping shot records). By relaxing the
                  insistence on replicability between surveys, we find
                  that recovery of the time-lapse difference shows
                  little variability for realistic field scenarios of
                  slightly nonreplicated surveys that suffer from
                  unavoidable natural deviations in spatial sampling
                  of shots (or receivers) and pragmatic
                  compressed-sensing based nonreplicated surveys when
                  compared to the "ideal" scenario of exact
                  replicability between surveys. Moreover, the
                  recovered densely sampled prestack baseline and
                  monitor data improve significantly when the
                  acquisitions are not replicated, and hence can serve
                  as input to extract poststack attributes used to
                  compute time-lapse differences. Our observations are
                  based on experiments conducted for an ocean-bottom
                  cable survey acquired with time-jittered continuous
                  recording assuming source equalization (or same
                  source signature) for the time-lapse surveys and no
                  changes in wave heights, water column velocities or

                  represented as lines in the Fourier domain. However,
                  in the real-world seismic events usually have
                  curvature or amplitude variability that means their
                  Fourier transforms are no longer strictly linear,
                  but rather occupy conic regions of the Fourier
                  domain that are narrow at low frequencies, but
                  broaden at high frequencies where the effect of
                  curvature becomes more pronounced. One can consider
                  these regions as localised "signal cones". In this
                  work, we consider a space-time variable signal cone
                  to model the seismic data. The variability of the
                  signal cone is obtained through scaling, slanting
                  and translation of the kernel for cone-limited
                  (C-limited) functions (functions whose Fourier
                  transform lives within a cone) or C-Gaussian
                  function (a multivariate function whose Fourier
                  transform decays exponentially with respect to
                  slowness and frequency) which constitutes our
                  dictionary. We find a discrete number of scaling,
                  slanting and translation parameters from a continuum
                  by optimally matching the data. This is a nonlinear
                  optimization problem which we address by a fixed
                  point method which utilizes a variable projection
                  method with e1 constraints on the linear parameters
                  and bound constraints on the nonlinear
                  parameters. We observe that slow decay and
                  oscillatory behavior of the kernel for C-limited
                  functions constitute bottlenecks for the
                  optimization problem which we partially overcome by
                  the C-Gaussian function. We demonstrate our method
                  through an interpolation example. We present the

                  velocity models can be generated, but, in the
                  absence of an accurate starting model, that
                  potential is difficult to realize in
                  practice. Presented are successful inversion
                  results, obtained from synthetic subsalt models,
                  using a robust full-waveform inversion code that
                  includes constraints upon the set of allowable earth
                  models. These constraints include limitations on the
                  total variation of the velocity of the model and,
                  most significantly, on the asymmetric variation of
                  velocity with depth such that negative velocity
                  excursions are limited. During the iteration, these
                  constraints are relaxed progressively so that the

                  data, but the constraints act to steer the inversion
                  path away from local minima in its early
                  stages. This methodology is applied to portions of

  abstract = {We propose an extended full-waveform inversion
                  formulation that includes general convex constraints
                  on the model. Though the full problem is highly
                  nonconvex, the overarching optimization scheme
                  arrives at geologically plausible results by solving
                  a sequence of relaxed and warm-started constrained
                  convex subproblems. The combination of box,
                  total-variation, and successively relaxed asymmetric
                  total-variation constraints allows us to steer free
                  from parasitic local minima while keeping the
                  estimated physical parameters laterally continuous
                  and in a physically realistic range. For accurate
                  starting models, numerical experiments carried out
                  on the challenging 2004 BP velocity benchmark
                  demonstrate that bound and total-variation
                  constraints improve the inversion result
                  significantly by removing inversion artifacts,
                  related to source encoding, and by clearly improved
                  delineation of top, bottom, and flanks of a
                  high-velocity high-contrast salt inclusion. The
                  experiments also show that for poor starting models
                  these two constraints by themselves are insufficient
                  to detect the bottom of high-velocity inclusions
                  such as salt. Inclusion of the one-sided asymmetric
                  total-variation constraint overcomes this issue by
                  discouraging velocity lows to buildup during the
                  early stages of the inversion. To the author's
                  knowledge the presented algorithm is the first to
                  successfully remove the imprint of local minima
                  caused by poor starting models and band-width

                  Sparse Inversion problem without any explicit data
                  reconstruction, from a seismic record with missing
                  near-offsets and large holes in the acquisition grid
                  which does not produce aliasing but otherwise causes
                  large errors in the multiple prediction. Exclusion
                  of the unknown data as an inversion variable from
                  the process is desirable, since it sidesteps
                  possible issues arising from fitting observations
                  that are also unknowns in the same inversion
                  problem. Instead, we simulate their multiple
                  contributions by augmenting the forward prediction
                  model for the total wavefield with a scattering
                  series that mimics the action of the free surface
                  reflector within the confines of the unobserved
                  trace locations. Each term in this scattering series
                  simply involves convolution of the predicted
                  wavefield once more with the current estimated
                  surface-free Green's function at these unobserved
                  locations. We investigate the necessary
                  modifications to the primary estimation algorithm to
                  account for the resulting nonlinearity in the
                  modeling operator, and also demonstrate that just a
                  few scattering terms are enough to satisfactorily
                  mitigate the effects of near-offset data gaps during
                  the inversion process. Numerical experiments on
                  synthetic data show that the final derived method
                  can significantly outperform explicit data
                  reconstruction for large near-offset gaps. This is
                  achieved with a similar computational cost and
                  better memory efficiency compared to explicit data
                  reconstruction. We also show on real data that our
                  scheme outperforms pre-interpolation of the

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion can be formulated as a nonlinear
                  least-squares optimization problem. This non-convex
                  problem can be extremely computationally expensive
                  because it requires repeatedly solving large linear
                  systems that correspond to discretized partial
                  differential equations. Randomized subsampling
                  techniques allow us to work with small subsets of
                  (monochromatic) source experiments, reducing the
                  computational cost. However, this subsampling
                  weakens subsurface illumination and introduces
                  subsampling related incoherent artifacts. These
                  subsampling-related artifacts---in conjunction with
                  local minima that are known to plague full-waveform
                  inversion---motivate us to come up with a technique
                  to "regularize" this problem. Following earlier
                  work, we take advantage of the fact that curvelets
                  represent subsurface models and perturbations
                  parsimoniously. At first impulse promoting sparsity
                  on the model directly seems the most natural way to
                  proceed, but we will demonstrate that in certain
                  cases it can be advantageous to promote sparsity on
                  the Gauss-Newton updates instead. While constraining
                  the one-norm of the descent directions does not
                  change not change the underlying full-waveform
                  inversion objective, the constrained model updates
                  remain descent directions, remove
                  subsampling-related artifacts and improve the
                  overall inversion result. We empirically observe
                  this phenomenon in situations where the different
                  model updates occur at roughly the same locations in
                  the curvelet domain. We further investigate and
                  analyze this phenomenon, where nonlinear inversions
                  benefit from sparsity-promoting constraints on the
                  updates, by means of a set of carefully selected
                  examples including phase retrieval and full-waveform
                  inversion. In all cases, we observe a faster decay
                  of the residual and model error as a function of the
                  number of iterations.},

                  sampling a smooth function on a regular (or
                  structured) grid. However, in many practical
                  situations the measurements are taken on an
                  irregular grid (that is accurately known). This
                  results in an "unstructured data matrix" that is

                  especially from data that contain strong
                  surface-related multiples. Conventional reverse-time
                  migration requires prior knowledge of the source
                  wavelet, which is either technically or
                  computationally challenging to accurately determine;
                  inaccurate estimates of the source wavelet can
                  result in seriously degraded reverse-time migrated
                  images, and therefore wrong geological
                  interpretations. To solve this problem, we present a
                  "wavelet-free" imaging procedure that simultaneously
                  inverts for the source wavelet and the seismic
                  image, by tightly integrating source estimation into
                  a fast least-squares imaging framework, namely
                  compressive imaging, given a reasonably accurate
                  background velocity model. However, this joint
                  inversion problem is difficult to solve as it is
                  plagued with local minima and the ambiguity with
                  respect to amplitude scalings because of the
                  multiplicative, and therefore nonlinear, appearance
                  of the source wavelet in the otherwise linear
                  formalism. We have found a way to solve this
                  nonlinear joint-inversion problem using a technique
                  called variable projection, and a way to overcome
                  the scaling ambiguity by including surface-related
                  multiples in our imaging procedure following recent
                  developments in surface-related multiple prediction
                  by sparse inversion. As a result, we obtain without
                  prior knowledge of the source wavelet
                  high-resolution seismic images, comparable in
                  quality to images obtained assuming the true source
                  wavelet is known. By leveraging the computationally
                  efficient compressive-imaging methodology, these
                  results are obtained at affordable computational
                  costs compared with conventional processing work
                  flows that include surface-related multiple removal

                  and velocity analysis in areas of complex
                  geology. Traditionally, these gathers are thought of
                  as multidimensional correlations of the source and
                  receiver wavefields. The bottleneck in computing
                  these gathers lies in the fact that one needs to
                  store, compute, and correlate these wavefields for
                  all shots in order to obtain the desired image
                  gathers. Therefore, the image gathers are typically
                  only computed for a limited number of subsurface
                  points and for a limited range of subsurface
                  offsets, which may cause problems in complex
                  geological areas with large geologic dips. We
                  overcome increasing computational and storage costs
                  of extended image volumes by introducing a
                  formulation that avoids explicit storage and removes
                  the customary and expensive loop over shots found in
                  conventional extended imaging. As a result, we end
                  up with a matrix–vector formulation from which
                  different image gathers can be formed and with which
                  amplitude-versus-angle and wave-equation migration
                  velocity analysis can be performed without requiring
                  prior information on the geologic dips. Aside from
                  demonstrating the formation of two-way extended
                  image gathers for different purposes and at greatly
                  reduced costs, we also present a new approach to
                  conduct automatic wave-equation-based
                  migration-velocity analysis. Instead of focusing in
                  particular offset directions and preselected subsets
                  of subsurface points, our method focuses every
                  subsurface point for all subsurface offset
                  directions using a randomized probing technique. As
                  a consequence, we obtain good velocity models at low
                  cost for complex models without the need to provide
                  information on the geologic dips.},

                  problems whose solutions are well-approximated by
                  Hierarchical Tucker (HT) tensors, an efficient
                  structured tensor format based on recursive subspace
                  factorizations. By exploiting the smooth manifold
                  structure of these tensors, we construct standard
                  optimization algorithms such as Steepest Descent and
                  Conjugate Gradient for completing tensors from
                  missing entries. Our algorithmic framework is fast
                  and scalable to large problem sizes as we do not
                  require SVDs on the ambient tensor space, as
                  required by other methods. Moreover, we exploit the
                  structure of the Gramian matrices associated with
                  the HT format to regularize our problem, reducing
                  overfitting for high subsampling ratios. We also
                  find that the organization of the tensor can have a

                  acquisition geometries. These samplings are far from
                  idealized randomized samplings that are usually
                  considered in the literature but are realizable in
                  practical scenarios. Using these algorithms, we

  abstract = {Despite recent developments in improved acquisition,
                  seismic data often remain undersampled along source
                  and receiver coordinates, resulting in incomplete
                  data for key applications such as migration and
                  multiple prediction. We have interpreted the
                  missing-trace interpolation problem in the context
                  of matrix completion (MC), and developed three
                  practical principles for using low-rank optimization
                  techniques to recover seismic data. Specifically, we
                  strive for recovery scenarios wherein the original
                  signal is low rank and the subsampling scheme
                  increases the singular values of the matrix. We use
                  an optimization program that restores this low-rank
                  structure to recover the full volume. Omitting one
                  or more of these principles can lead to poor
                  interpolation results, as we found
                  experimentally. In light of this theory, we
                  compensate for the high-rank behavior of data in the
                  source-receiver domain by using the midpoint-offset
                  transformation for 2D data and a source-receiver
                  permutation for 3D data to reduce the overall
                  singular values. Simultaneously, to work with
                  computationally feasible algorithms for large-scale
                  data, we use a factorization-based approach to MC,
                  which significantly speeds up the computations
                  compared with repeated singular value decompositions
                  without reducing the recovery quality. In the
                  context of our theory and experiments, we also find
                  that windowing the data too aggressively can have
                  adverse effects on the recovery quality. To overcome
                  this problem, we carried out our interpolations for
                  each frequency independently while working with the
                  entire frequency slice. The result is a
                  computationally efficient, theoretically motivated
                  framework for interpolating missing-trace data. Our
                  tests on realistic 2D and 3D seismic data sets show
                  that our method compares favorably in terms of
                  computational speed and recovery quality with
                  existing curvelet- and tensor-based techniques.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous marine acquisition is an economic way to
                  sample seismic data and speed up acquisition,
                  wherein single or multiple source vessels fire
                  sources at near-simultaneous or slightly random
                  times, resulting in overlapping shot records. The
                  current paradigm for simultaneous towed-streamer
                  marine acquisition incorporates “low variability” in
                  source firing times, i.e., 0 ≤ 1 or 2 s because the
                  sources and receivers are moving. This results in a
                  low degree of randomness in simultaneous data, which
                  is challenging to separate (into its constituent
                  sources) using compressed-sensing-based separation
                  techniques because randomization is key to
                  successful recovery via compressed sensing. We have
                  addressed the challenge of source separation for
                  simultaneous towed-streamer acquisitions via two
                  compressed-sensing-based approaches, i.e., sparsity
                  promotion and rank minimization. We have evaluated
                  the performance of the sparsity-promotion- and
                  rank-minimization-based techniques by simulating two
                  simultaneous towed-streamer acquisition scenarios,
                  i.e., over/under and simultaneous long offset. A
                  field data example from the Gulf of Suez for the
                  over/under acquisition scenario was also
                  developed. We observed that the proposed approaches
                  gave good and comparable recovery qualities of the
                  separated sources, but the rank-minimization
                  technique outperformed the sparsity-promoting
                  technique in terms of the computational time and
                  memory. We also compared these two techniques with
                  the normal-moveout-based median-filtering-type
                  approach, which had comparable results.},

  abstract = {In marine exploration seismology, surface-related
                  multiples are usually treated as noise mainly
                  because subsequent processing steps, such as
                  migration velocity analysis and imaging, require
                  multiple-free data. Failure to remove these
                  wavefield components from the data may lead to
                  erroneous estimates for migration velocity or result
                  in strong coherent artefacts that interfere with the
                  imaged reflectors. However, multiples can carry
                  complementary information compared to primaries, as
                  they interact with the free surface and are
                  therefore exposed more to the subsurface. Recent
                  work has shown that when processed correctly
                  multiples can improve seismic illumination. Given a
                  sufficiently accurate background velocity model and
                  an estimate for the source signature, we propose a
                  new and computationally efficient linearized
                  inversion procedure based on two-way wave equations,
                  which produces accurate images of the subsurface
                  from the total upgoing wavefield including
                  surface-related multiples. Modelling of the
                  surface-related multiples in the proposed method
                  derives from the well-known surface-related multiple
                  elimination method. We incur a minimal overhead from
                  incorporating the multiples by having the
                  wave-equation solver carry out the multiple
                  predictions via the inclusion of an areal source
                  instead of expensive dense matrix-matrix
                  multiplications. By using subsampling techniques, we
                  obtain high-quality true-amplitude least-squares
                  migrated images at computational costs of roughly a
                  single reverse-time migration (RTM) with all the
                  data. These images are virtually free of coherent
                  artefacts from multiples. Proper inversion of the
                  multiples would be computationally infeasible
                  without using these techniques that significantly
                  bring down the cost. By promoting sparsity in the
                  curvelet domain and using rerandomization, out
                  method gains improved robustness to errors in the
                  background velocity model, and errors incurred in
                  the linearization of the wave equation with respect
                  to the model. We demonstrate the superior
                  performance of the proposed method compared to the
                  conventional RTM using realistic synthetic
                  examples.},

  abstract = {In marine seismic acquisition, surface-related multiples
                  constitute a significant portion of the acquired
                  data. Typically, multiples are removed during
                  early-stage data-processing as they can lead to
                  phantom reflectors during migration that may result
                  in erroneous geological interpretations. However, if
                  properly dealt with, multiples can provide valuable
                  extra information and complement primaries in
                  illuminating the subsurface. In this article, we
                  demonstrate the limitation of the reverse-time
                  migration in imaging these multiples, and present an
                  alternative inversion procedure that is
                  computationally efficient, that jointly maps both
                  primaries and multiples to the true reflectors, and
                  where the source function is estimated on the
                  fly. As a result, we obtain high-quality, mostly
                  artifact-free, broad-band images where the imprint
                  of the source-function are partly removed at a
                  computationally affordable expense compared to the
                  combined costs of the wave-equation based
                  surface-related multiple elimination and the
                  reverse-time migration. We achieve all this by
                  including the total downgoing wavefields as areal
                  sources in the least-squares migration in
                  combination with curvelet-domain sparsity promotion.
                  We apply the proposed method to a shallow-water
                  marine data set from the North sea, which contains
                  abundant short-period surface-related multiples, and
                  show its efficacy in eliminating coherent imaging
                  artifacts associated with these multiples. We also
                  demonstrate the benefits of joint imaging of
                  primaries and multiples compared to imaging these
                  signal components separately.},

  abstract = {Many inverse and parameter estimation problems can be
                  written as PDE-constrained optimization
                  problems. The goal is to infer the parameters,
                  typically coefficients of the PDE, from partial
                  measurements of the solutions of the PDE for several
                  right-hand sides. Such PDE-constrained problems can
                  be solved by finding a stationary point of the
                  Lagrangian, which entails simultaneously updating
                  the parameters and the (adjoint) state
                  variables. For large-scale problems, such an
                  all-at-once approach is not feasible as it requires
                  storing all the state variables. In this case one
                  usually resorts to a reduced approach where the
                  constraints are explicitly eliminated (at each
                  iteration) by solving the PDEs. These two
                  approaches, and variations thereof, are the main
                  workhorses for solving PDE-constrained optimization
                  problems arising from inverse problems. In this
                  paper, we present an alternative method that aims to
                  combine the advantages of both approaches. Our
                  method is based on a quadratic penalty formulation
                  of the constrained optimization problem. By
                  eliminating the state variable, we develop an
                  efficient algorithm that has roughly the same
                  computational complexity as the conventional reduced
                  approach while exploiting a larger search
                  space. Numerical results show that this method
                  indeed reduces some of the nonlinearity of the
                  problem and is less sensitive to the initial
                  iterate.},

  abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion aims at obtaining detailed
                  estimates of subsurface medium parameters, such as
                  the spatial distribution of soundspeed, from
                  multiexperiment seismic data. A formulation of this
                  inverse problem in the frequency domain leads to an
                  optimization problem constrained by a Helmholtz
                  equation with many right-hand sides. Application of
                  this technique to industry-scale problems faces
                  several challenges: First, we need to solve the
                  Helmholtz equation for high wave numbers over large
                  computational domains. Second, the data consist of
                  many independent experiments, leading to a large
                  number of PDE solves. This results in high
                  computational complexity both in terms of memory and
                  CPU time as well as input/output costs. Finally, the
                  inverse problem is highly nonlinear and a lot of art
                  goes into preprocessing and regularization. Ideally,
                  an inversion needs to be run several times with
                  different initial guesses and/or tuning
                  parameters. In this paper, we discuss the
                  requirements of the various components (PDE solver,
                  optimization method, \dots) when applied to
                  large-scale three-dimensional seismic waveform
                  inversion and combine several existing approaches
                  into a flexible inversion scheme for seismic
                  waveform inversion. The scheme is based on the idea
                  that in the early stages of the inversion we do not
                  need all the data or very accurate PDE solves. We
                  base our method on an existing preconditioned Krylov
                  solver (CARP-CG) and use ideas from stochastic
                  optimization to formulate a gradient-based
                  (quasi-Newton) optimization algorithm that works
                  with small subsets of the right-hand sides and uses
                  inexact PDE solves for the gradient calculations. We
                  propose novel heuristics to adaptively control both
                  the accuracy and the number of right-hand sides. We
                  illustrate the algorithms on synthetic benchmark
                  models for which significant computational gains can
                  be made without being sensitive to noise and without
                  losing the accuracy of the inverted model.},

                  completion in extremely large-scale applications,

                  we consider matrix completion formulations designed

                  easy to apply the algorithm in practice, leaving
                  only the factor rank to be determined. Within the
                  established framework, we propose two extensions
                  that are highly relevant to solving practical
                  challenges of data interpolation. First, we propose
                  a weighted extension that allows known subspace
                  information to improve the results of matrix
                  completion formulations. We show how this weighting
                  can be used in the context of frequency
                  continuation, an essential aspect to seismic data
                  interpolation. Second, we propose matrix completion
                  formulations that are robust to large measurement
                  errors in the available data. We illustrate the
                  advantages of LR-BPDN on collaborative filtering
                  problems using the MovieLens 1M and 10M and Netflix
                  100M datasets. Then we use the new method, along
                  with its robust and subspace reweighted extensions,
                  to obtain high-quality reconstructions for
                  large-scale seismic interpolation problems with real
                  data, even in the presence of data contamination.},

  abstract = {Wave-equation based methods, such as the estimation of
                  primaries by sparse inversion, have been successful
                  in the mitigation of the adverse effects of
                  surface-related multiples on seismic imaging and
                  migration-velocity analysis. However, the reliance
                  of these methods on multidimensional convolutions
                  with fully sampled data exposes the ‘curse of
                  dimensionality’, which leads to disproportional
                  growth in computational and storage demands when
                  moving to realistic 3D field data. To remove this
                  fundamental impediment, we propose a
                  dimensionality-reduction technique where the ‘data
                  matrix’ is approximated adaptively by a randomized
                  low-rank factorization. Compared to conventional
                  methods, which need for each iteration passage
                  through all data possibly requiring on-the-fly
                  interpolation, our randomized approach has the
                  advantage that the total number of passes is reduced
                  to only one to three. In addition, the low-rank
                  matrix factorization leads to considerable
                  reductions in storage and computational costs of the
                  matrix multiplies required by the sparse
                  inversion. Application of the proposed method to
                  two-dimensional synthetic and real data shows that
                  significant performance improvements in speed and
                  memory use are achievable at a low computational
                  up-front cost required by the low-rank

  pages = {661-667},
  abstract = {Wave equation based inversions, such as full-waveform
                  inversion and reverse-time migration, are
                  challenging because of their computational costs,
                  memory requirements and reliance on accurate initial
                  models. To confront these issues, we propose a novel
                  formulation of wave equation based inversion based
                  on a penalty method. In this formulation, the
                  objective function consists of a data-misfit term
                  and a penalty term, which measures how accurately
                  the wavefields satisfy the wave equation. This new
                  approach is a major departure from current
                  formulations where forward and adjoint wavefields,
                  which both satisfy the wave equation, are correlated
                  to compute updates for the unknown model
                  parameters. Instead, we carry out the inversions
                  over two alternating steps during which we first
                  estimate the wavefield everywhere, given the current
                  model parameters, source and observed data, followed
                  by a second step during which we update the model
                  parameters, given the estimate for the wavefield
                  everywhere and the source. Because the inversion
                  involves both the synthetic wavefields and the
                  medium parameters, its search space is enlarged so
                  that it suffers less from local minima. Compared to
                  other formulations that extend the search space of
                  wave equation based inversion, our method differs in
                  several aspects, namely (i) it avoids storage and
                  updates of the synthetic wavefields because we
                  calculate these explicitly by finding solutions that
                  obey the wave equation and fit the observed data and
                  (ii) no adjoint wavefields are required to update
                  the model, instead our updates are calculated from
                  these solutions directly, which leads to significant
                  computational savings. We demonstrate the validity
                  of our approach by carefully selected examples and
                  discuss possible extensions and future research.},

                  promotion has proven to be an effective tool to
                  solve this recovery problem, current recovery
                  techniques do not fully utilize a priori information
                  derived from the locations of the transform-domain
                  coefficients, especially when curvelet domain
                  sparsity is exploited. We use recovery by weighted
                  one-norm minimization, which exploits correlations
                  between the locations of significant curvelet
                  coefficients of different partitions, e.g., shot
                  records, common-offset gathers, or frequency slices

                  for adaptive subtraction of approximate multiple

                  multiple-free subsurface impulse response as a
                  collection of band-limited spikes. Although it can
                  be shown that the correct primary impulse response
                  is obtained through the sparsest possible solution,
                  the original EPSI algorithm was not designed to take
                  advantage of this result, and instead it relies on a
                  multitude of inversion parameters, such as the level
                  of sparsity per gradient update. We proposed and
                  tested a new algorithm, named robust EPSI, in which
                  we make obtaining the sparsest solution an explicit
                  goal. Our approach remains a gradient-based approach
                  like the original algorithm, but it is derived from
                  a new biconvex optimization framework based on an
                  extended basis-pursuit denoising
                  formulation. Furthermore, because it is based on a
                  general framework, robust EPSI can recover the
                  impulse response in transform domains, such as
                  sparsifying curvelet-based representations, without
                  changing the underlying algorithm. We discovered
                  that the sparsity-minimizing objective of our
                  formulation enabled it to operate successfully on a
                  variety of synthetic and field marine data sets
                  without excessive tweaking of inversion
                  parameters. We also found that recovering the
                  solution in alternate sparsity domains can
                  significantly improve the quality of the directly
                  estimated primaries, especially for weaker
                  late-arrival events. In addition, we found that
                  robust EPSI produces a more artifact-free impulse

                  Sparsity-promoting Inversion, adapted from the
                  recently-developed theory of compressive sensing, is
                  one such kind of reconstruction, especially good for
                  recovery of undersampled seismic data. Like
                  traditional Fourier-based methods, it performs best
                  when used in conjunction with randomized
                  subsampling, which converts aliases from the usual
                  regular periodic subsampling into easy-to-eliminate
                  noise. By virtue of its ability to control gap size,
                  along with the random and irregular nature of its
                  sampling pattern, jittered (sub)sampling is one

                  more difficult problem, with both underlying
                  Cartesian, and hexagonal grids. We also study what
                  we term separable and non-separable two-dimensional
                  jittered samplings. We find hexagonal jittered
                  sampling performs better than Cartesian jittered
                  sampling, while fully non-separable jittered
                  sampling performs better than separable jittered
                  sampling. Two other 2D randomized sampling methods,
                  Poisson Disk sampling and Farthest Point sampling,
                  both known to possess blue-noise spectra, are also

                  determining highly heterogeneous subsurface
                  structure. However, conventional waveform inversion
                  requires that the wavefield for each source is
                  computed separately. This makes it very expensive
                  for realistic 3D seismic surveys. Source-encoding
                  waveform inversion, in which the sources are
                  modelled simultaneously, is considerably faster than
                  conventional waveform inversion but suffers from
                  artifacts. These artifacts can partly be removed by
                  assigning random weights to the source

                  waveform inversion is an unbiased random estimation
                  of the misfit function used in conventional waveform
                  inversion. We found a new method of source-encoding
                  waveform inversion which takes into account the
                  random nature of the gradients used in the
                  optimization. In this new method, the gradient at
                  each iteration is a weighted average of past
                  gradients such that the most recent gradients have
                  the largest weights with exponential decay. This way
                  we damped the random fluctuations of the gradient by
                  incorporating information from the previous
                  iterations. We compare this new method with existing
                  source-encoding waveform inversion methods as well
                  as conventional waveform inversion and found that
                  the model misfit reduction is faster and smoother
                  than those of existing source-encoding waveform
                  inversion methods, and it approaches the model
                  misfit reduction obtained in conventional waveform
                  inversion.},

                  mapped to that level by a process called
                  interferometric redatuming. After redatuming, the
                  obtained wavefields can be used for imaging below
                  this particular depth level. Interferometric
                  redatuming consists of two steps, namely (i) the
                  decomposition of the observed wavefields into up-
                  and down-going constituents and (ii) a
                  multidimensional deconvolution of the up- and
                  downgoing wavefields. While this method works in
                  theory, sensitivity to noise and artifacts due to
                  incomplete acquisition call for a different

                  certain artifacts while preserving the frequency
                  content. These improvements lead to a better image
                  of the target from the redatumed data.},

                  problem. Basis pursuit denoise (BPDN) fits the
                  least-squares problem only approximately, and a
                  single parameter determines a curve that traces the
                  optimal trade-off between the least-squares fit and
                  the one-norm of the solution. We prove that this
                  curve is convex and continuously differentiable over
                  all points of interest, and show that it gives an
                  explicit relationship to two other optimization

                  recovery rate of sequential SMV using L1

                  be solved with one approach but not with the

                  recover primary parameters. Structure present in
                  these problems allows efficient optimization
                  strategies - a well known example is variable
                  projection, where nonlinear least squares problems
                  which are linear in some parameters can be very
                  efficiently optimized. In this paper, we extend the
                  idea of projecting out a subset over the variables
                  to a broad class of maximum likelihood (ML) and
                  maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) problems with
                  nuisance parameters, such as variance or degrees of
                  freedom. As a result, we are able to incorporate

                  constrained and unconstrained inverse problem
                  formulations. We apply the approach to a variety of
                  problems, including estimation of unknown variance

                  (d.o.f.)  parameter estimation in the context of

                  primary parameters for several large- scale inverse
                  problems. The proposed approach is compatible with a
                  wide variety of algorithms and formulations, and its

                  rocks were marbles containing varying concentrations
                  of dispersed quartz grains. Pores were present
                  throughout the rock, but the largest ones were
                  preferentially associated with the quartz particles,
                  leading us to characterize the material as being
                  composed of two phases, one with high permeability
                  and the second with low permeability. We measured
                  the permeability and storativity of these materials
                  using the oscillating flow technique, while
                  systematically varying the effective pressure and
                  the period and amplitude of the input fluid
                  oscillation. Control measurements performed using
                  the steady state flow and pulse decay techniques
                  agreed well with the oscillating flow tests. The
                  hydraulic properties of the marbles were highly
                  sensitive to the volume fraction of the
                  high-permeability phase (directly related to the
                  quartz content). Below a critical quartz content,
                  slightly less than 20 wt \%, the high-permeability
                  volume elements were disconnected, and the overall
                  permeability was low. Above the critical quartz
                  content the high-permeability volume elements formed
                  throughgoing paths, and permeability increased
                  sharply.  We numerically simulated fluid flow
                  through binary materials and found that permeability
                  approximately obeys a percolation-based mixing law,

  abstract = {The regularization of a convex program is exact if all
                  solutions of the regularized problem are also
                  solutions of the original problem for all values of
                  the regularization parameter below some positive
                  threshold. For a general convex program, we show
                  that the regularization is exact if and only if a
                  certain selection problem has a Lagrange
                  multiplier. Moreover, the regularization parameter
                  threshold is inversely related to the Lagrange
                  multiplier. We use this result to generalize an
                  exact regularization result of Ferris and
                  Mangasarian [Appl. Math.  Optim., 23(1991),
                  pp. 266{\textendash}273] involving a linearized
                  selection problem. We also use it to derive
                  necessary and sufficient conditions for exact
                  penalization, similar to those obtained by Bertsekas
                  [Math. Programming, 9(1975), pp. 87{\textendash}99]
                  and by Bertsekas, Nedi , Ozdaglar [Convex Analysis
                  and Optimization, Athena Scientific, Belmont, MA,
                  2003]. When the regularization is not exact, we
                  derive error bounds on the distance from the
                  regularized solution to the original solution
                  set. We also show that existence of a
                  {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}weak sharp
                  minimum{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} is in some
                  sense close to being necessary for exact
                  regularization. We illustrate the main result with
                  numerical experiments on the l1 regularization of
                  benchmark (degenerate) linear programs and
                  semidefinite/second-order cone programs. The
                  experiments demonstrate the usefulness of l1
                  regularization in finding sparse solutions.},

  abstract = {Often, parameter estimation problems of
                  parameter-dependent PDEs involve multiple right-hand
                  sides. The computational cost and memory
                  requirements of such problems increase linearly with
                  the number of right-hand sides. For many
                  applications this is the main bottleneck of the
                  computation.  In this paper we show that problems
                  with multiple right-hand sides can be reformulated
                  as stochastic programming problems by combining the
                  right-hand sides into a few „simultaneous”
                  sources. This effectively reduces the cost of the
                  forward problem and results in problems that are
                  much cheaper to solve. We discuss two solution
                  methodologies: namely sample average approximation
                  and stochastic approximation. To illustrate the
                  effectiveness of our approach we present two model
                  problems, direct current resistivity and seismic
                  tomography.},

  abstract = {Geophysical inverse problems typically involve a trade
                  off between data misfit and some prior. Pareto
                  curves trace the optimal trade off between these two
                  competing aims. These curves are commonly used in
                  problems with two-norm priors where they are plotted
                  on a log-log scale and are known as L-curves. For
                  other priors, such as the sparsity-promoting one
                  norm, Pareto curves remain relatively unexplored. We
                  show how these curves lead to new insights in
                  one-norm regularization. First, we confirm the

                  of these curves from a stylized and a geophysical
                  example. Second, we exploit these crucial properties
                  to approximate the Pareto curve for a large-scale
                  problem. Third, we show how Pareto curves provide an
                  objective criterion to gauge how different one-norm

  abstract = {We extend our earlier work on the nonequispaced fast
                  discrete curvelet transform (NFDCT) and introduce a
                  second generation of the transform. This new
                  generation differs from the previous one by the
                  approach taken to compute accurate curvelet
                  coefficients from irregularly sampled data. The
                  first generation relies on accurate Fourier
                  coefficients obtained by an l2-regularized inversion
                  of the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (FFT)
                  whereas the second is based on a direct
                  l1-regularized inversion of the operator that links
                  curvelet coefficients to irregular data. Also, by
                  construction the second generation NFDCT is lossless
                  unlike the first generation NFDCT. This property is
                  particularly attractive for processing irregularly
                  sampled seismic data in the curvelet domain and
                  bringing them back to their irregular record-ing
                  locations with high fidelity. Secondly, we combine
                  the second generation NFDCT with the standard fast
                  discrete curvelet transform (FDCT) to form a new
                  curvelet-based method, coined nonequispaced curvelet
                  reconstruction with sparsity-promoting inversion
                  (NCRSI) for the regularization and interpolation of
                  irregularly sampled data. We demonstrate that for a
                  pure regularization problem the reconstruction is
                  very accurate. The signal-to-reconstruction error
                  ratio in our example is above 40 dB. We also conduct
                  combined interpolation and regularization
                  experiments. The reconstructions for synthetic data
                  are accurate, particularly when the recording
                  locations are optimally jittered. The reconstruction
                  in our real data example shows amplitudes along the
                  main wavefronts smoothly varying with limited
                  acquisition imprint.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new discrete undersampling
                  scheme designed to favor wavefield reconstruction by
                  sparsity-promoting inversion with transform elements
                  that are localized in the Fourier domain. Our work
                  is motivated by empirical observations in the
                  seismic community, corroborated by recent results
                  from compressive sampling, which indicate favorable
                  (wavefield) reconstructions from random as opposed
                  to regular undersampling. As predicted by theory,
                  random undersampling renders coherent aliases into
                  harmless incoherent random noise, effectively
                  turning the interpolation problem into a much
                  simpler denoising problem. A practical requirement
                  of wavefield reconstruction with localized
                  sparsifying transforms is the control on the maximum
                  gap size. Unfortunately, random undersampling does
                  not provide such a control and the main purpose of
                  this paper is to introduce a sampling scheme, coined
                  jittered undersampling, that shares the benefits of
                  random sampling, while offering control on the
                  maximum gap size. Our contribution of jittered
                  sub-Nyquist sampling proves to be key in the
                  formulation of a versatile wavefield
                  sparsity-promoting recovery scheme that follows the
                  principles of compressive sampling. After studying
                  the behavior of the jittered undersampling scheme in
                  the Fourier domain, its performance is studied for
                  curvelet recovery by sparsity-promoting inversion
                  (CRSI). Our findings on synthetic and real seismic
                  data indicate an improvement of several decibels
                  over recovery from regularly-undersampled data for
                  the same amount of data collected.},

                  subsequently mined for information during
                  processing.  Although this approach has been
                  extremely successful in the past, current efforts
                  toward higher-resolution images in increasingly
                  complicated regions of the earth continue to reveal
                  fundamental shortcomings in our workflows. Chiefly
                  among these is the so-called
                  {\textquotedblleft}curse of
                  dimensionality{\textquotedblright} exemplified by
                  Nyquist{\textquoteright}s sampling criterion, which
                  disproportionately strains current acquisition and
                  processing systems as the size and desired
                  resolution of our survey areas continue to
                  increase. We offer an alternative sampling method
                  leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing
                  toward seismic acquisition and processing for data
                  that are traditionally considered to be
                  undersampled. The main outcome of this approach is a
                  new technology where acquisition and processing
                  related costs are no longer determined by overly
                  stringent sampling criteria, such as Nyquist. At the
                  heart of our approach lies randomized incoherent
                  sampling that breaks subsampling related
                  interferences by turning them into harmless noise,
                  which we subsequently remove by promoting
                  transform-domain sparsity. Now, costs no longer grow
                  significantly with resolution and dimensionality of
                  the survey area, but instead depend only on
                  transform-domain sparsity. Our contribution is
                  twofold. First, we demonstrate by means of carefully
                  designed numerical experiments that compressive
                  sensing can successfully be adapted to seismic
                  exploration.  Second, we show that accurate recovery
                  can be accomplished for compressively sampled data
                  volumes sizes that exceed the size of conventional
                  transform-domain data volumes by only a small
                  factor. Because compressive sensing combines
                  transformation and encoding by a single linear
                  encoding step, this technology is directly
                  applicable to acquisition and to dimensionality
                  reduction during processing. In either case,
                  sampling, storage, and processing costs scale with
                  transform-domain sparsity. We illustrate this
                  principle by means of number of case studies.},

  abstract = {In this paper an alternative approach to the blind
                  seismic deconvolution problem is presented that aims
                  for two goals namely recovering the location and
                  relative strength of seismic reflectors, possibly
                  with super-localization, as well as obtaining
                  detailed parametric characterizations for the
                  reflectors. We hope to accomplish these goals by
                  decomposing seismic data into a redundant dictionary
                  of parameterized waveforms designed to closely match
                  the properties of reflection events associated with
                  sedimentary records. In particular, our method
                  allows for highly intermittent non-Gaussian records
                  yielding a reflectivity that can no longer be
                  described by a stationary random process or by a
                  spike train. Instead, we propose a reflector
                  parameterization that not only recovers the
                  reflector{\textquoteright}s location and relative
                  strength but which also captures reflector
                  attributes such as its local scaling, sharpness and
                  instantaneous phase-delay. The first set of
                  parameters delineates the stratigraphy whereas the
                  second provides information on the lithology. As a
                  consequence of the redundant parameterization,
                  finding the matching waveforms from the dictionary
                  involves the solution of an ill-posed problem. Two
                  complementary sparseness-imposing methods Matching
                  and Basis Pursuit are compared for our dictionary

                  upper-mantle seismic discontinuities. We propose a
                  percolation-based model for the elastic properties
                  of the phase mixture in the coexistence regions
                  associated with these transitions. The major
                  consequence of the model is that the elastic moduli
                  (but not the density) display a singularity at the
                  percolation threshold of the high-pressure
                  phase. This model not only explains the sharp but
                  continuous change in seismic velocities across the
                  phase transition, but also predicts its abruptness
                  and scale invariance, which are characterized by a
                  non-integral scale exponent. Using the
                  receiver-function approach and new, powerful
                  signal-processing techniques, we quantitatively
                  determine the singularity exponent from recordings
                  of converted seismic waves at two Australian

                  we construct velocity{\textendash}depth profiles

  abstract = {Predictive multiple suppression methods consist of two
                  main steps: a prediction step, during which
                  multiples are predicted from seismic data, and a
                  primary-multiple separation step, during which the
                  predicted multiples are
                  {\textquoteright}matched{\textquoteright} with the
                  true multiples in the data and subsequently
                  removed. This second separation step, which we will
                  call the estimation step, is crucial in practice: an
                  incorrect separation will cause residual multiple
                  energy in the result or may lead to a distortion of
                  the primaries, or both. To reduce these adverse
                  effects, a new transformed-domain method is proposed
                  where primaries and multiples are separated rather
                  than matched. This separation is carried out on the
                  basis of differences in the multiscale and
                  multidirectional characteristics of these two signal
                  components. Our method uses the curvelet transform,
                  which maps multidimensional data volumes into almost
                  orthogonal localized multidimensional prototype
                  waveforms that vary in directional and
                  spatio-temporal content. Primaries-only and
                  multiples-only signal components are recovered from
                  the total data volume by a non-linear optimization
                  scheme that is stable under noisy input data. During
                  the optimization, the two signal components are
                  separated by enhancing sparseness (through weighted
                  l1-norms) in the transformed domain subject to
                  fitting the observed data as the sum of the
                  separated components to within a user-defined
                  tolerance level. Whenever, during the optimization,
                  the estimates for the primaries in the transformed
                  domain correlate with the predictions for the
                  multiples, the recovery of the coefficients for the
                  estimated primaries will be suppressed while for
                  regions where the correlation is small the method
                  seeks the sparsest set of coefficients that
                  represent the estimation for the primaries. Our
                  algorithm does not seek a matched filter and as such
                  it differs fundamentally from traditional adaptive
                  subtraction methods. The method derives its
                  stability from the sparseness obtained by a
                  non-parametric (i.e. not depending on a parametrized
                  physical model) multiscale and multidirectional
                  overcomplete signal representation. This sparsity
                  serves as prior information and allows for a
                  Bayesian interpretation of our method during which
                  the log-likelihood function is minimized while the
                  two signal components are assumed to be given by a
                  superposition of prototype waveforms, drawn
                  independently from a probability function that is
                  weighted by the predicted primaries and
                  multiples. In this paper, the predictions are based
                  on the data-driven surface-related multiple
                  elimination method. Synthetic and field data
                  examples show a clean separation leading to a
                  considerable improvement in multiple suppression
                  compared to the conventional method of adaptive
                  matched filtering. This improved separation
                  translates into an improved stack.},

                  for iterative techniques to attain accurate
                  migration amplitudes. These iterative methods are
                  important because they complement theoretical
                  approaches that are hampered by difficulties to
                  control problems such as finite-acquisition
                  aperture, source-receiver frequency response, and
                  directivity. To solve these problems, we apply
                  preconditioning, which significantly improves
                  convergence of least-squares migration. We discuss
                  different levels of preconditioning that range from
                  corrections for the order of the migration operator
                  to corrections for spherical spreading, and position
                  and reflector-dip dependent amplitude errors. While
                  the first two corrections correspond to simple

                  major impediment within seismic imaging. By turning

                  sampling the sources, followed by solving a reduced

                  otherwise regular acquisition grids forms a crucial
                  step in the seismic processing flow. For instance,
                  unsuccessful recovery leads to imaging artifacts and
                  to erroneous predictions for the multiples,
                  adversely affecting the performance of multiple
                  elimination. A non-parametric transform-based
                  recovery method is presented that exploits the
                  compression of seismic data volumes by recently
                  developed curvelet frames. The elements of this
                  transform are multidimensional and directional and
                  locally resemble wavefronts present in the data,
                  which leads to a compressible representation for
                  seismic data. This compression enables us to
                  formulate a new curvelet-based seismic data recovery
                  algorithm through sparsity-promoting inversion. The
                  concept of sparsity-promoting inversion is in itself
                  not new to geophysics. However, the recent insights
                  from the field of {\textquoteleft}compressed
                  sensing{\textquoteright} are new since they clearly
                  identify the three main ingredients that go into a
                  successful formulation of a recovery problem, namely
                  a sparsifying transform, a sampling strategy that
                  subdues coherent aliases and a sparsity-promoting
                  program that recovers the largest entries of the
                  curvelet-domain vector while explaining the
                  measurements. These concepts are illustrated with a
                  stylized experiment that stresses the importance of
                  the degree of compression by the sparsifying
                  transform. With these findings, a curvelet-based
                  recovery algorithms is developed, which recovers
                  seismic wavefields from seismic data volumes with
                  large percentages of traces missing. During this
                  construction, we benefit from the main three
                  ingredients of compressive sampling, namely the
                  curvelet compression of seismic data, the existence
                  of a favorable sampling scheme and the formulation
                  of a large-scale sparsity-promoting solver based on
                  a cooling method. The recovery performs well on
                  synthetic as well as real data and performs better
                  by virtue of the sparsifying property of
                  curvelets. Our results are applicable to other areas
                  such as global seismology.},

                  relying on the minimization of a least-squares
                  misfit functional as a function of the medium
                  perturbation. The success of this procedure hinges
                  on our ability to handle large systems of
                  equations---whose size grows exponentially with the
                  demand for higher resolution images in more and more
                  complicated areas---and our ability to invert these
                  systems given a limited amount of computational
                  resources. To overcome this "curse of
                  dimensionality" in problem size and computational
                  complexity, we propose a combination of randomized
                  dimensionality-reduction and divide-and-conquer
                  techniques. This approach allows us to take
                  advantage of sophisticated sparsity-promoting
                  solvers that work on a series of smaller subproblems
                  each involving a small randomized subset of
                  data. These subsets correspond to artificial
                  simultaneous-source experiments made of random
                  superpositions of sequential-source experiments. By
                  changing these subsets after each subproblem is
                  solved, we are able to attain an inversion quality
                  that is competitive while requiring fewer
                  computational, and possibly, fewer acquisition
                  resources. Application of this concept to a
                  controlled series of experiments showed the validity
                  of our approach and the relationship between its
                  efficiency---by reducing the number of sources and
                  hence the number of wave-equation solves---and the
                  image quality. Application of our
                  dimensionality-reduction methodology with sparsity
                  promotion to a complicated synthetic with well-log

                  this normal operator corresponds to a
                  pseudodifferential operator, for which a convenient
                  diagonal approximation in the curvelet domain is
                  derived, including a bound for its error and a
                  method for the estimation of the diagonal from a
                  compound operator consisting of discrete
                  implementations for the scattering operator and its
                  adjoint the migration operator. The solution is
                  formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem where
                  sparsity in the curvelet domain as well as
                  continuity along the imaged reflectors are jointly
                  promoted. To enhance sparsity, the $ell_1$-norm on the
                  curvelet coefficients is minimized, while continuity
                  is promoted by minimizing an anisotropic diffusion
                  norm on the image. The performance of the recovery

                  primaries and multiples greatly determines the
                  quality of seismic imaging. Despite major advances
                  made by surface-related multiple elimination (SRME),
                  amplitude errors in the predicted multiples remain a
                  problem. When these errors vary for each type of
                  multiple in different ways (as a function of offset,
                  time, and dip), they pose a serious challenge for
                  conventional least-squares matching and for the
                  recently introduced separation by curvelet-domain
                  thresholding. We propose a data-adaptive method that
                  corrects amplitude errors, which vary smoothly as a
                  function of location, scale (frequency band), and
                  angle. With this method, the amplitudes can be
                  corrected by an elementwise curvelet-domain scaling
                  of the predicted multiples. We show that this
                  scaling leads to successful estimation of primaries,
                  despite amplitude, sign, timing, and phase errors in
                  the predicted multiples. Our results on synthetic
                  and real data show distinct improvements over
                  conventional least-squares matching in terms of
                  better suppression of multiple energy and

                  leveraging recent insights from compressive sensing
                  towards seismic acquisition and processing for data
                  that, from a traditional point of view, are

                  this approach is a new technology where acquisition
                  and processing related costs are decoupled the
                  stringent Nyquist sampling criterion. At the heart
                  of our approach lies randomized incoherent sampling
                  that breaks subsampling-related interferences by
                  turning them into harmless noise, which we
                  subsequently remove by promoting sparsity in a
                  transform-domain. Acquisition schemes designed to
                  fit into this regime no longer grow significantly in
                  cost with increasing resolution and dimensionality
                  of the survey area, but instead its cost ideally
                  only depends on transform-domain sparsity of the
                  expected data. Our contribution is twofold. First,
                  we demonstrate by means of carefully designed
                  numerical experiments that ideas from compressive
                  sensing can be adapted to seismic
                  acquisition. Second, we leverage the property that
                  seismic data volumes are well approximated by a
                  small percentage of curvelet coefficients. Thus
                  curvelet-domain sparsity allows us to recover
                  conventionally-sampled seismic data volumes from
                  compressively-sampled data volumes whose size
                  exceeds this percentage by only a small
                  factor. Because compressive sensing combines
                  transformation and encoding by a single linear
                  encoding step, this technology is directly
                  applicable to seismic acquisition and therefore
                  constitutes a new paradigm where acquisitions costs
                  scale with transform-domain sparsity instead of the
                  gridsize. We illustrate this principle by showcasing
                  recovery of a real seismic line from simulated
                  compressively sampled acquisitions.},

  abstract = {Suppression of incoherent noise, which is present in the
                  seismic signal and may often lead to ambiguous
                  interpretation, is a key step in processing
                  associated with crustal reflection data. In this
                  paper, we make use of the parsimonious
                  representation of seismic data in the curvelet
                  domain to perform the noise attenuation while
                  preserving the coherent energy and its amplitude
                  information. Curvelets are a recently developed
                  mathematical transform that has as one of its
                  properties minimal overlap between seismic signal
                  and noise in the transform domain, thereby
                  facilitating signal-noise separation. The problem is
                  cast as an inverse problem and the results are
                  obtained by updating the solution at each
                  iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
                  procedure at removing noise on both synthetic shot
                  gathers and a synthetic stacked seismic section. We
                  then apply curvelet denoising to deep crustal
                  seismic reflection data where the signal-to-noise
                  ratio is low. The reflection data were recorded
                  along Lithoprobe's SNORCLE Line 1 across
                  Paleoproterozoic-Archean domains in Canada's
                  Northwest Territories. After initial processing, we
                  apply the iterative curvelet denoising to both
                  pre-stack shot gathers and post-stack data. Ground
                  roll, random noise and much of the anomalous
                  vertical energy is removed from the pre-stack shot
                  gathers, to the extent that crustal reflections,
                  including those from the Moho, are clearly seen on
                  individual gathers. Denoised stacked data show a
                  series of dipping reflections in the lower crust
                  that extend into the Moho. The Moho itself is
                  relatively flat and characterized by a sharp, narrow
                  band of reflections. Comparing the results for the
                  stacked data with those from F-X deconvolution,
                  curvelet denoising outperforms the latter by
                  attenuating incoherent noise with minimal harm to
                  the signal. Because curvelet denoising retains
                  amplitude information, it provides opportunities for
                  further studies of seismic sections through
                  attribute analyses. Curvelet denoising provides an
                  important new tool in the processing toolbox for
                  crustal seismic reflection data.},

  abstract = {We explore the use of stochastic optimization methods
                  for seismic waveform inversion. The basic principle
                  of such methods is to randomly draw a batch of
                  realizations of a given misfit function and goes
                  back to the 1950s. The ultimate goal of such an
                  approach is to dramatically reduce the computational
                  cost involved in evaluating the misfit. Following
                  earlier work, we introduce the stochasticity in
                  waveform inversion problem in a rigorous way via a
                  technique called randomized trace estimation. We
                  then review theoretical results that underlie recent
                  developments in the use of stochastic methods for
                  waveform inversion. We present numerical experiments
                  to illustrate the behavior of different types of
                  stochastic optimization methods and investigate the
                  sensitivity to the batch size and the noise level in
                  the data. We find that it is possible to reproduce
                  results that are qualitatively similar to the
                  solution of the full problem with modest batch
                  sizes, even on noisy data. Each iteration of the
                  corresponding stochastic methods requires an order
                  of magnitude fewer PDE solves than a comparable
                  deterministic method applied to the full problem,
                  which may lead to an order of magnitude speedup for
                  waveform inversion in practice.},

  title = {Fast waveform inversion without source encoding},
  journal = {Geophysical Prospecting},
  year = {2013},

  pages = {10-19},
  abstract = {Randomized source encoding has recently been proposed as
                  a way to dramatically reduce the costs of full
                  waveform inversion. The main idea is to replace all
                  sequential sources by a small number of simultaneous
                  sources. This introduces random crosstalk in the
                  model updates and special stochastic optimization
                  strategies are required to deal with this. Two
                  problems arise with this approach: i) source
                  encoding can only be applied to fixed-spread
                  acquisition setups, and ii) stochastic optimization
                  methods tend to converge very slowly, relying on
                  averaging to get rid of the cross-talk. Although the
                  slow convergence is partly offset by the low
                  iteration cost, we show that conventional
                  optimization strategies are bound to outperform
                  stochastic methods in the long run. In this paper we
                  argue that we don¬øt need randomized source encoding
                  to reap the benefits of stochastic optimization and
                  we review an optimization strategy that combines the
                  benefits of both conventional and stochastic
                  optimization. The method uses a gradually increasing
                  batch of sources. Thus, iterations are very cheap
                  initially and this allows the method to make fast
                  progress in the beginning. As the batch size grows,
                  the method behaves like conventional optimization,
                  allowing for fast convergence. Numerical examples
                  suggest that the stochastic and hybrid method
                  perform equally well with and without source
                  encoding and that the hybrid method outperforms both
                  conventional and stochastic optimization. The method
                  does not rely on source encoding techniques and can
                  thus be applied to non fixed-spread data.},

  abstract = {Wave-equation based seismic inversion can be formulated
                  as a nonlinear inverse problem where the medium
                  properties are obtained via minimization of a least-
                  squares misfit functional. The demand for higher
                  resolution models in more geologically complex areas
                  drives the need to develop techniques that explore
                  the special structure of full-waveform inversion to
                  reduce the computational burden and to regularize
                  the inverse problem. We meet these goals by using
                  ideas from compressive sensing and stochastic
                  optimization to design a novel Gauss-Newton method,
                  where the updates are computed from random subsets
                  of the data via curvelet-domain sparsity
                  promotion. Application of this idea to a realistic
                  synthetic shows improved results compared to
                  quasi-Newton methods, which require passes through
                  all data. Two different subset sampling strategies
                  are considered: randomized source encoding, and
                  drawing sequential shots firing at random source
                  locations from marine data with missing near and far
                  offsets. In both cases, we obtain excellent
                  inversion results compared to conventional methods
                  at reduced computational costs. },

  abstract = {An explicit algorithm for the extrapolation of one-way
                  wavefields is proposed that combines recent
                  developments in information theory and theoretical
                  signal processing with the physics of wave
                  propagation. Because of excessive memory
                  requirements, explicit formulations for wave
                  propagation have proven to be a challenge in 3D. By
                  using ideas from compressed sensing, we are able to
                  formulate the (inverse) wavefield extrapolation
                  problem on small subsets of the data volume, thereby
                  reducing the size of the operators. Compressed
                  sensing entails a new paradigm for signal recovery
                  that provides conditions under which signals can be
                  recovered from incomplete samplings by nonlinear
                  recovery methods that promote sparsity of the
                  to-be-recovered signal. According to this theory,
                  signals can be successfully recovered when the
                  measurement basis is incoherent with the
                  representa-tion in which the wavefield is sparse. In
                  this new approach, the eigenfunctions of the
                  Helmholtz operator are recognized as a basis that is
                  incoherent with curvelets that are known to compress
                  seismic wavefields. By casting the wavefield
                  extrapolation problem in this framework, wavefields
                  can be successfully extrapolated in the modal
                  domain, despite evanescent wave modes.  The degree
                  to which the wavefield can be recovered depends on
                  the number of missing (evanescent) wavemodes and on
                  the complexity of the wavefield. A proof of
                  principle for the compressed sensing method is given
                  for inverse wavefield extrapolation in 2D, together
                  with a pathway to 3D during which the multiscale and
                  multiangular properties of curvelets, in relation to
                  the Helmholz operator, are exploited. The results
                  show that our method is stable, has reduced dip
                  limitations, and handles evanescent waves in inverse
                  extrapolation. {\copyright}2007 Society of

  abstract = {Seismic data acquisition in marine environments is a
                  costly process that calls for the adoption of
                  simultaneous-source or randomized acquisition - an
                  emerging technology that is stimulating both
                  geophysical research and commercial
                  efforts. Simultaneous marine acquisition calls for
                  the development of a new set of design principles
                  and post-processing tools. In this paper, we discuss
                  the properties of a specific class of randomized
                  simultaneous acquisition matrices and demonstrate
                  that sparsity-promoting recovery improves the
                  quality of reconstructed seismic data volumes. We
                  propose a practical randomized marine acquisition
                  scheme where the sequential sources fire airguns at
                  only randomly time-dithered instances. We
                  demonstrate that the recovery using sparse
                  approximation from random time-dithering with a
                  single source approaches the recovery from
                  simultaneous-source acquisition with multiple
                  sources. Established findings from the field of
                  compressive sensing indicate that the choice of the
                  sparsifying transform that is incoherent with the
                  compressive sampling matrix can significantly impact
                  the reconstruction quality. Leveraging these
                  findings, we then demonstrate that the compressive
                  sampling matrix resulting from our proposed sampling
                  scheme is incoherent with the curvelet
                  transform. The combined measurement matrix exhibits
                  better isometry properties than other transform
                  bases such as a non-localized multidimensional
                  Fourier transform. We illustrate our results with
                  simulations of "ideal" simultaneous-source marine
                  acquisition, which dithers both in time and space,
                  compared with periodic and randomized

  abstract = {In this note, we address the theoretical properties of
                  $\Delta_p$, a class of compressed sensing decoders
                  that rely on $l^p$ minimization with $p \in (0,1)$
                  to recover estimates of sparse and compressible
                  signals from incomplete and inaccurate
                  measurements. In particular, we extend the results
                  of Cand{\textquoteleft}es, Romberg and Tao [3] and
                  Wojtaszczyk [30] regarding the decoder $\Delta_1$,
                  based on $\ell^1$ minimization, to $\Delta p$ with
                  $p \in (0,1)$. Our results are two-fold. First, we
                  show that under certain sufficient conditions that
                  are weaker than the analogous sufficient conditions
                  for $\Delta_1$ the decoders $\Delta_p$ are robust to
                  noise and stable in the sense that they are $(2,p)$
                  instance optimal. Second, we extend the results of
                  Wojtaszczyk to show that, like $\Delta_1$, the
                  decoders $\Delta_p$ are (2,2) instance optimal in
                  probability provided the measurement matrix is drawn
                  from an appropriate distribution. While the
                  extension of the results of [3] to the setting where
                  $p \in (0,1)$ is straightforward, the extension of
                  the instance optimality in probability result of
                  [30] is non-trivial. In particular, we need to prove
                  that the $LQ_1$ property, introduced in [30], and
                  shown to hold for Gaussian matrices and matrices
                  whose columns are drawn uniformly from the sphere,
                  generalizes to an $LQ_p$ property for the same
                  classes of matrices. Our proof is based on a result
                  by Gordon and Kalton [18] about the Banach-Mazur

  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Inverse problems in (exploration) seismology are known
                  for their large to very large scale. For instance,
                  certain sparsity-promoting inversion techniques
                  involve vectors that easily exceed unknowns while
                  seismic imaging involves the construction and
                  application of matrix-free discretized operators
                  where single matrix-vector evaluations may require
                  hours, days or even weeks on large compute
                  clusters. For these reasons, software development in
                  this field has remained the domain of highly
                  technical codes programmed in low-level languages
                  with little eye for easy development, code reuse and
                  integration with (nonlinear) programs that solve
                  inverse problems.Following ideas from the
                  Symes{\textquoteright} Rice Vector Library and
                  Bartlett{\textquoteright}s C++ object-oriented
                  interface, Thyra, and Reduction/Transformation
                  operators (both part of the Trilinos software
                  package), we developed a software-development
                  environment based on overloading. This environment
                  provides a pathway from in-core prototype
                  development to out-of-core and MPI
                  {\textquoteright}production{\textquoteright} code
                  with a high level of code reuse. This code reuse is
                  accomplished by integrating the out-of-core and MPI
                  functionality into the dynamic object-oriented
                  programming language Python. This integration is
                  implemented through operator overloading and allows
                  for the development of a coordinate-free solver
                  framework that (i) promotes code reuse; (ii)
                  analyses the statements in an abstract syntax tree
                  and (iii) generates executable statements. In the
                  current implementation, we developed an interface to
                  generate executable statements for the out-of-core
                  unix-pipe based (seismic) processing package
                  RSF-Madagascar (rsf.sf.net). The modular design
                  allows for interfaces to other seismic processing
                  packages and to in-core Python packages such as
                  numpy. So far, the implementation overloads linear
                  operators and element-wise reduction/transformation
                  operators. We are planning extensions towards
                  nonlinear operators and integration with existing
                  (parallel) solver frameworks such as Trilinos.},

  title = {Source estimation and uncertainty quantification for wave-equation based seismic imaging and inversion},
  school = {The University of British Columbia},
  year = {2018},
  month = {04},
  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {In  modern  seismic  exploration, wave-equation-based inversion and imaging approaches  are  widely employed for their potential  of  creating  high-resolution subsurface images from seismic data by using the wave equation
to describe  the  underlying  physical model of  wave  propagation. Despite
their successful practical applications, some key issues remain unsolved, including local minima, unknown sources, and the largely missing uncertainty
analyses  for  the  inversion. This  thesis  aims  to  address  the  following two
aspects:  to perform the inversion without prior knowledge of sources, and
to quantify uncertainties in the inversion. The unknown source can hinder the success of wave-equation-based ap-
proaches.  A simple time shift in the source can lead to misplaced reflectors
in  linearized  inversions  or  large  disturbances  in  nonlinear  problems. Unfortunately, accurate sources are typically unknown in real problems.  The first major contribution of this thesis is, given the fact that the wave equation linearly depends on the sources, I have proposed on-the-fly source estimation techniques for the following wave-equation-based approaches: (1)
time-domain  sparsity-promoting  least-squares  reverse-time  migration;  and
(2) wavefield-reconstruction  inversion. Considering the linear dependence
of the wave equation on the sources, I project out the sources by solving a
linear least-squares problem, which enables us to conduct successful wave-
equation-based inversions without prior knowledge of the sources.
Wave-equation-based  approaches  also  produce  uncertainties in the resulting velocity model due to the  noisy  data, which would influence the
subsequent exploration and financial decisions. The difficulties related to
practical uncertainty quantification lie in: (1) expensive computation related
to wave-equation solves, and (2) the nonlinear parameter-to-data map. The
second major contribution of this thesis is the proposal of a computationally
feasible Bayesian framework to analyze uncertainties in the resulting velocity models. Through relaxing the wave-equation constraints, I obtain a less
nonlinear parameter-to-data map and a posterior distribution that can be adequately approximated by a Gaussian distribution. I derive an implicit
formulation to construct the covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution,
which allows us to sample the Gaussian distribution in a computationally
efficient manner. I demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian framework can
provide adequately accurate uncertainty analyses for intermediate to large-
scale problems with an acceptable computational cost.},

  title = {Large-scale optimization algorithms for missing data completion and inverse problems},
  school = {The University of British Columbia},
  year = {2017},
  month = {09},
  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {Inverse problems are an important class of problems
                  found in many areas of science and engineering. In
                  these problems, one aims to estimate unknown
                  parameters of a physical system through indirect
                  multi-experiment measurements. Inverse problems
                  arise in a number of fields including seismology,
                  medical imaging, and astronomy, among others. An
                  important aspect of inverse problems is the quality
                  of the acquired data itself. Real-world data
                  acquisition restrictions, such as time and budget
                  constraints, often results in measured data with
                  missing entries. Many inversion algorithms assume
                  that the input data is fully sampled and relatively
                  noise free and produce poor results when these
                  assumptions are violated. Given the multidimensional
                  nature of real-world data, we propose a new low-rank
                  optimization method on the smooth manifold of
                  Hierarchical Tucker tensors. Tensors that exhibit
                  this low-rank structure can be recovered from
                  solving this non-convex program in an efficient
                  manner. We successfully interpolate realistically
                  sized seismic data volumes using this approach. If
                  our low-rank tensor is corrupted with non-Gaussian
                  noise, the resulting optimization program can be
                  formulated as a convex-composite problem. This class
                  of problems involves minimizing a non-smooth but
                  convex objective composed with a nonlinear smooth
                  mapping. In this thesis, we develop a level set
                  method for solving composite-convex problems and
                  prove that the resulting subproblems converge
                  linearly. We demonstrate that this method is
                  competitive when applied to examples in noisy tensor
                  completion, analysis-based compressed sensing, audio
                  declipping, total-variation deblurring and
                  denoising, and one-bit compressed sensing. With
                  respect to solving the inverse problem itself, we
                  introduce a new software design framework that
                  manages the cognitive complexity of the various
                  components involved. Our framework is modular by
                  design, which enables us to easily integrate and
                  replace components such as linear solvers, finite
                  difference stencils, preconditioners, and
                  parallelization schemes. As a result, a researcher
                  using this framework can formulate her algorithms
                  with respect to high-level components such as
                  objective functions and hessian operators. We
                  showcase the ease with which one can prototype such
                  algorithms in a 2D test problem and, with little
                  code modification, apply the same method to
                  large-scale 3D problems.},

  month = {08},
  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {In this thesis, I adapt ideas from the field of
                  compressed sensing to mitigate the computational and
                  memory bottleneck of seismic processing workflows
                  such as missing-trace interpolation, source
                  separation and wave-equation based inversion for
                  large-scale 3- and 5-D seismic data. For
                  interpolation and source separation using
                  rank-minimization, I propose three main ingredients,
                  namely a rank-revealing transform domain, a
                  subsampling scheme that increases the rank in the
                  transform domain, and a practical large-scale
                  data-consistent rank-minimization framework, which
                  avoids the need for expensive computation of
                  singular value decompositions. We also devise a
                  wave-equation based factorization approach that
                  removes computational bottlenecks and provides
                  access to the kinematics and amplitudes of
                  full-subsurface offset extended images via actions
                  of full extended image volumes on probing vectors,
                  which I use to perform the amplitude-versus- angle
                  analyses and automatic wave-equation migration
                  velocity analyses on complex geological
                  environments. After a brief overview of matrix
                  completion techniques in Chapter 1, we propose a
                  singular value decomposition (SVD)-free
                  factorization based rank-minimization approach for
                  large-scale matrix completion problems. Then, I
                  extend this framework to deal with large-scale
                  seismic data interpolation problems, where I show
                  that the standard approach of partitioning the
                  seismic data into windows is not required, which use
                  the fact that events tend to become linear in these
                  windows, while exploiting the low-rank structure of
                  seismic data. Carefully selected synthetic and
                  realistic seismic data examples validate the
                  efficacy of the interpolation framework. Next, I
                  extend the SVD-free rank-minimization approach to
                  remove the seismic cross-talk in simultaneous source
                  acquisition. Experimental results verify that source
                  separation using the SVD-free rank-minimization
                  approaches are comparable to the sparsity-promotion
                  based techniques; however, separation via
                  rank-minimization is significantly faster and memory
                  efficient. We further introduce a matrix-vector
                  formulation to form full-subsurface extended image
                  volumes, which removes the storage and computational
                  bottleneck found in the convention methods. I
                  demonstrate that the proposed matrix-vector
                  formulation is used to form different image gathers
                  with which amplitude-versus-angle and wave-equation
                  migration velocity analyses is performed, without
                  requiring prior information on the geologic
                  dips. Finally, I conclude the thesis by outlining
                  potential future research directions and extensions
                  of the thesis work.},

  abstract = {The work in this thesis adapts ideas from the field of
                  compressive sensing (CS) that lead to new insights
                  into acquiring and processing seismic data, where we
                  can fundamentally rethink how we design seismic
                  acquisition surveys and process acquired data to
                  minimize acquisition- and processing-related
                  costs. Current efforts towards dense source/receiver
                  sampling and full azimuthal coverage to produce
                  high-resolution images of the subsurface have led to
                  the deployment of multiple sources across survey
                  areas. A step ahead from multisource acquisition is
                  simultaneous-source acquisition, where multiple
                  sources fire shots at near-simultaneous/random times
                  resulting in overlapping shot records, in comparison
                  to no overlaps during conventional sequential-source
                  acquisition. Adoption of simultaneous-source
                  techniques has helped to improve survey efficiency
                  and data density. The engine that drives
                  simultaneous-source technology is
                  simultaneous-source separation --- a methodology
                  that aims to recover conventional sequential-source
                  data from simultaneous-source data. This is
                  essential because many seismic processing techniques
                  rely on dense and periodic (or regular)
                  source/receiver sampling. We address the challenge
                  of source separation through a combination of
                  tailored simultaneous-source acquisition design and
                  sparsity-promoting recovery via convex optimization
                  using l1 objectives. We use CS metrics to
                  investigate the relationship between marine
                  simultaneous-source acquisition design and data
                  reconstruction fidelity, and consequently assert the
                  importance of randomness in the acquisition system
                  in combination with an appropriate choice for a
                  sparsifying transform (i.e., curvelet transform) in
                  the reconstruction algorithm. We also address the
                  challenge of minimizing the cost of expensive,
                  dense, periodically-sampled and replicated
                  time-lapse surveying and data processing by adapting
                  ideas from distributed compressive sensing. We show
                  that compressive randomized time-lapse surveys need
                  not be replicated to attain acceptable levels of
                  data repeatability, as long as we know the shot
                  positions (post acquisition) to a sufficient degree
                  of accuracy. We conclude by comparing
                  sparsity-promoting and rank-minimization recovery
                  techniques for marine simultaneous-source
                  separation, and demonstrate that recoveries are
                  comparable; however, the latter approach readily
                  scales to large-scale seismic data and is
                  computationally faster.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents a novel viewpoint on the implicit
                  opportunities randomized surveys bring to time-lapse
                  seismic - which is a proven surveillance tool for
                  hydrocarbon reservoir monitoring. Time-lapse (4D)
                  seismic combines acquisition and processing of at
                  least two seismic datasets (or vintages) in order to
                  extract information related to changes in a
                  reservoir within a specified time interval. The
                  current paradigm places stringent requirements on
                  replicating the 4D surveys, which is an expensive
                  task often requiring uneconomical dense sampling of
                  seismic wavefields. To mitigate the challenges of
                  dense sampling, several advances in seismic
                  acquisition have been made in recent years including
                  the use of multiple sources firing at near
                  simultaneous random times, and the adaptation of
                  Compressive Sensing (CS) principles to design
                  practical acquisition engines that improve sampling
                  efficiency for seismic data acquisition. However,
                  little is known regarding the implications of these
                  developments for time-lapse studies. By conducting
                  multiple experiments modelling surveys adhering to
                  the principles of CS for 4D seismic, I propose a
                  model that demonstrates the feasibility of
                  randomized acquisitions for time-lapse seismic. The
                  proposed joint recovery model (JRM), which derives
                  from distributed CS, exploits the common information
                  in time-lapse data during recovery of dense
                  wavefields from measured subsampled data, providing
                  highly repeatable and high-fidelity vintages. I show
                  that we obtain better vintages when randomized
                  surveys are not replicated, in contrast to standard
                  practice, paving the way for an opportunity to relax
                  the rigorous requirement to replicate surveys
                  precisely. We assert that the vintages obtained
                  using our proposed model are of sufficient quality
                  to serve as inputs to processes that extract
                  time-lapse attributes from which subsurface changes
                  are deduced. Additionally, I show that recovery with
                  the JRM is robust with respect to errors due to
                  differences between actual and recorded postplot
                  information. Finally, I present an opportunity to
                  adapt our model to problems related to time-lapse
                  seismic imaging where the main finding is that we
                  can better delineate time-lapse changes by adapting
                  the joint recovery model to wave-equation based

                  Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (Robust
                  EPSI, or REPSI). Surface-related multiples are a
                  major source of coherent noise in seismic data, and
                  inferring fine geological structures from
                  active-source seismic recordings typically first
                  necessitates its removal or mitigation. For this
                  task, current practice calls for data-driven
                  approaches which produce only approximate multiple
                  models that must be non-linearly subtracted from the
                  data, often distorting weak primary events in the
                  process. A recently proposed method called
                  Estimation of Primaries by Sparse Inversion (EPSI)
                  avoids this adaptive subtraction by directly
                  inverting for a discrete representation of the
                  underlying multiple-free subsurface impulse response
                  as a set of band-limited spikes. However, in its
                  original form, the EPSI algorithm exhibits a few
                  notable shortcomings that impede adoption. Although
                  it was shown that the correct impulse response can
                  be obtained through a sparsest solution criteria,
                  the current EPSI algorithm is not designed to take
                  advantage of this finding, but instead approximates
                  a sparse solution in an ad-hoc manner that requires
                  practitioners to decide on a multitude of inversion
                  parameters. The Robust EPSI method introduced in
                  this thesis reformulates the original EPSI problem
                  as a formal bi-convex optimization problem that
                  makes obtaining the sparsest solution an explicit
                  goal, while also reliably admit satisfactory
                  solutions using contemporary self-tuning gradient
                  methods commonly seen in large-scale machine
                  learning communities. I show that the Robust EPSI
                  algorithm is able to operate successfully on a
                  variety of datasets with minimal user input, while
                  also producing a more accurate model of the
                  subsurface impulse response when compared to the
                  original algorithm. Furthermore, this thesis makes
                  several contributions that improves the capability
                  and practicality of EPSI: a novel scattering-based
                  multiple prediction model that allows Robust EPSI to
                  deal with wider near-offset receiver gaps than
                  previously demonstrated for EPSI, as well as a
                  multigrid-inspired continuation strategy that
                  significantly reduces the computation time needed to
                  solve EPSI-type problems. These additions are
                  enabled by and built upon the formalism of the
                  Robust EPSI as developed in this thesis.},

  title = {Fast imaging with surface-related multiples},
  school = {The University of British Columbia},

  address = {Vancouver},
  abstract = {Surface-related multiples, which are waves that bounce
                  more than once between the water surface and the
                  subsurface reflectors, constitute a significant part
                  of the data acquired in marine seismic surveys. If
                  left untreated, they can lead to misplaced phantom
                  reflectors in the image, and result in erroneous
                  interpretations of the subsurface structure. As a
                  result, these multiples are removed before the
                  imaging procedure in conventional seismic data
                  processing. However, because they interact more with
                  the subsurface medium, they may carry extra
                  information that is not present in the primaries.
                  Therefore instead of removing these multiples, a
                  more desirable alternative is to make active use of
                  them. We derive from the well-established
                  "Surface-Related Multiple Elimination" relation, and
                  arrive at a linearized expression of the
                  wave-equation based modelling that incorporates the
                  surface- related multiples.  We then present a
                  computationally efficient approach to iteratively
                  invert this expression to obtain an image of the
                  subsurface from data that contain multiples. We
                  achieve the computational efficiency inside each
                  iteration by (i) using the wave-equation solver to
                  implicitly carry out the expensive multiple
                  prediction; and (ii) reducing the number of
                  wave-equation solves during data simulation by
                  subsampling the monochromatic source experiments. We
                  show that, compared with directly applying the
                  cross-correlation/deconvolutional imaging
                  conditions, the presented approach can suppress the
                  coherent imaging artifacts from multiples more
                  effectively. We also show that, by curvelet-domain
                  sparsity promoting and occasionally drawing new data
                  samples during the inversion, the proposed inversion
                  method gains improved robustness to velocity errors
                  in the background model, as well as modelling errors
                  incurred during linearization of the
                  wave-equation. To combine the information encoded in
                  both the primaries and the multiples, we then
                  propose a highly accurate source estimation method
                  to jointly invert the total upgoing wavefield. We
                  show with field data examples that we can reap
                  benefits from both the relative noise-free primaries
                  and the extra illumination coverage of the
                  multiples. We also demonstrate that the inclusion of
                  multiples help mitigate the amplitude ambiguity
                  during source estimation. We conclude the thesis
                  with an outlook for future research directions, as
                  well as potential extensions of the proposed work.},

  abstract = {This thesis will address the large computational costs
                  of solving least-squares migration and full-waveform
                  inversion problems. Least-squares seismic imaging
                  and full-waveform inversion are seismic inversion
                  techniques that require iterative minimizations of
                  large least-squares misfit functions. Each iteration
                  requires an evaluation of the Jacobian operator and
                  its adjoint, both of which require two wave-equation
                  solves for all sources, creating prohibitive
                  computational costs. In order to reduce costs, we
                  utilize randomized dimensionality reduction
                  techniques, reducing the number of sources used
                  during inversion. The randomized dimensionality
                  reduction techniques create subsampling related
                  artifacts, which we mitigate by using
                  curvelet-domain sparsity-promoting inversion
                  techniques. Our method conducts least-squares
                  imaging at the approximate cost of one reverse-time
                  migration with all sources, and computes the
                  Gauss-Newton full-waveform inversion update at
                  roughly the cost of one gradient update with all
                  sources. Finally, during our research of the
                  full-waveform inversion problem, we discovered that
                  we can utilize our method as an alternative approach
                  to add sparse constraints on the entire velocity
                  model by imposing sparsity constraints on each model
                  update separately, rather than regularizing the
                  total velocity model as typically practiced. We also
                  observed this alternative approach yields a faster
                  decay of the residual and model error as a function
                  of iterations. We provided empirical arguments why
                  and when imposing sparsity on the updates can lead
                  to improved full-waveform inversion results.},

  abstract = {Migration can accurately locate reflectors in the earth
                  but in most cases fails to correctly resolve their
                  amplitude. This might lead to mis-interpretation of
                  the nature of reflector. In this thesis, I
                  introduced a method to accurately recover the
                  amplitude of the seismic reflector. This method
                  relies on a new transform-based recovery that
                  exploits the expression of seismic images by the
                  recently developed curvelet transform. The elements
                  of this transform, called curvelets, are
                  multi-dimensional, multi-scale, and
                  multi-directional. They also remain approximately
                  invariant under the imaging operator. I exploit
                  these properties of the curvelets to introduce a
                  method called Curvelet Match Filtering (CMF) for
                  recovering the seismic amplitude in presence of
                  noise in both migrated image and data. I detail the
                  method and illustrate its performance on synthetic
                  dataset. I also extend CMF formulation to other
                  geophysical applications and present results on
                  multiple removal. In addition of that, I investigate
                  preconditioning of the migration which results to
                  rapid convergence rate of the iterative method using
                  migration.},

  abstract = {Wavefield reconstruction is a crucial step in the
                  seismic processing flow. For instance, unsuccessful
                  interpolation leads to erroneous multiple
                  predictions that adversely affect the performance of
                  multiple elimination, and to imaging artifacts. We
                  present a new non-parametric transform-based
                  reconstruction method that exploits the compression
                  of seismic data by the recently developed curvelet
                  transform. The elements of this transform, called
                  curvelets, are multi-dimensional, multi-scale, and
                  multi-directional. They locally resemble wavefronts
                  present in the data, which leads to a compressible
                  representation for seismic data. This compression
                  enables us to formulate a new curvelet-based seismic
                  data recovery algorithm through sparsity-promoting
                  inversion (CRSI). The concept of sparsity-promoting
                  inversion is in itself not new to
                  geophysics. However, the recent insights from the
                  field of {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}compressed
                  sensing{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} are new
                  since they clearly identify the three main
                  ingredients that go into a successful formulation of
                  a reconstruction problem, namely a sparsifying
                  transform, a sub-Nyquist sampling strategy that
                  subdues coherent aliases in the sparsifying domain,
                  and a data-consistent sparsity-promoting
                  program. After a brief overview of the curvelet
                  transform and our seismic-oriented extension to the
                  fast discrete curvelet transform, we detail the CRSI
                  formulation and illustrate its performance on
                  synthetic and real datasets. Then, we introduce a
                  sub-Nyquist sampling scheme, termed jittered
                  undersampling, and show that, for the same amount of
                  data acquired, jittered data are best interpolated
                  using CRSI compared to regular or random
                  undersampled data. We also discuss the large-scale
                  one-norm solver involved in CRSI. Finally, we extend
                  CRSI formulation to other geophysical applications
                  and present results on multiple removal and
                  migration-amplitude recovery.},

                  Helmholtz equation. The method is mainly based on a
                  Krylov method, preconditioned by a special operator
                  which represents a damped Helmholtz operator. The
                  discretization of the preconditioning operator is
                  then solved by one multigrid sweep. It can be shown
                  that while the spectrum is bounded above by one, the
                  smallest eigenvalue of the preconditioned system is
                  of order $k^{-1}$. In this situation, the
                  convergence of a Krylov method will be proportional
                  to the frequency of the problem. Further convergence
                  acceleration can be achieved if eigenvalues of order
                  $k^{-1}$ are projected from the spectrum. This can
                  be done by a projection operator, similar to but

  abstract = {A review has been given of the surface-related multiple
                  problem by making use of the so-called feedback
                  model. From the resulting equations it has been
                  concluded that the proposed solution does not
                  require any properties of the subsurface. However,
                  source-detector and reflectivity properties of the
                  surface need be specified. Those properties have
                  been quantified in a surface operator and this
                  operator is estimated as part of the multiple
                  removal problem. The surface-related multiple
                  removal algorithm has been formulated in terms of a
                  Neumann series and in terms of an iterative
                  equation. The Neumann formulation requires a
                  nonlinear optimization process for the surface
                  operator; while the iterative formulation needs a
                  number of linear optimizations. The iterative
                  formulation also has the advantage that it can be
                  integrated easily with another multiple removal
                  method. An algorithm for the removal of internal
                  multiples has been proposed as well. This algorithm
                  is an extension of the surface-related
                  method. Removal of internal multiples requires
                  knowledge of the macro velocity model between the
                  surface and the upper boundary of the multiple
                  generating layer. In part II (also published in this
                  issue) the success of the proposed algorithms has
                  been demonstrated on numerical experiments and field

  abstract = {This paper argues that curvelets provide a powerful tool
                  for representing very general linear symmetric
                  systems of hyperbolic differential
                  equations. Curvelets are a recently developed
                  multiscale system [10, 7] in which the elements are
                  highly anisotropic at fine scales, with effective
                  support shaped according to the parabolic scaling
                  principle width ≈ length^2 at fine scales. We prove
                  that for a wide class of linear hyperbolic
                  differential equations, the curvelet representation
                  of the solution operator is both optimally sparse
                  and well organized. * It is sparse in the sense that
                  the matrix entries decay nearly exponentially fast
                  (i.e. faster than any negative polynomial), * and
                  well-organized in the sense that the very few
                  nonnegligible entries occur near a few shifted
                  diagonals. Indeed, we show that the wave group maps
                  each curvelet onto a sum of curvelet-like waveforms
                  whose locations and orientations are obtained by
                  following the different Hamiltonian flows---hence
                  the diagonal shifts in the curvelet representation.
                  A physical interpretation of this result is that
                  curvelets may be viewed as coherent waveforms with
                  enough frequency localization so that they behave
                  like waves but at the same time, with enough spatial
                  localization so that they simultaneously behave like
                  particles.},

  abstract = {This paper describes two digital implementations of a
                  new mathematical transform, namely, the second
                  generation curvelet transform [12, 10] in two and
                  three dimensions. The first digital transformation
                  is based on unequally-spaced fast Fourier transforms
                  (USFFT) while the second is based on the wrapping of
                  specially selected Fourier samples. The two
                  implementations essentially differ by the choice of
                  spatial grid used to translate curvelets at each
                  scale and angle. Both digital transformations return
                  a table of digital curvelet coefficients indexed by
                  a scale parameter, an orientation parameter, and a
                  spatial location parameter. And both implementations
                  are fast in the sense that they run in O(n^2 log n)
                  flops for n by n Cartesian arrays; in addition, they
                  are also invertible, with rapid inversion algorithms
                  of about the same complexity. Our digital
                  transformations improve upon earlier
                  implementations---based upon the first generation of
                  curvelets---in the sense that they are conceptually
                  simpler, faster and far less redundant. The software
                  CurveLab, which implements both transforms presented

                  otherwise smooth ob ject with discontinuities along
                  edges, one must use an adaptive representation that
                  in some sense `tracks' the shape of the
                  discontinuity set. This folk-belief --- some would
                  say folk-theorem --- is incorrect. At the very
                  least, the possible quantitative advantage of such
                  adaptation is vastly smaller than commonly
                  believed. We have recently constructed a tight frame
                  of curvelets which provides stable, efficient, and
                  near-optimal representation of otherwise smooth ob
                  jects having discontinuities along smooth curves. By
                  applying naive thresholding to the curvelet
                  transform of such an ob ject, one can form m-term
                  approximations with rate of L2 approximation
                  rivaling the rate obtainable by complex adaptive
                  schemes which attempt to `track' the discontinuity
                  set. In this article we explain the basic issues of
                  efficient m-term approximation, the construction of
                  efficient adaptive representation, the construction
                  of the curvelet frame, and a crude analysis of the

  abstract = {Curvelets can represent local plane waves. They
                  efficiently decompose seismic images and possibly
                  imaging operators. We study how curvelets are
                  distorted after demigration followed by migration in
                  a different velocity model. We show that for small
                  local velocity perturbations, the
                  demigration/migration is reduced to a simple
                  morphing of the initial curvelet. The derivation of
                  the expected curvature of the curvelets shows that
                  it is easier to sparsify the demigration/migration
                  operator than the migration operator. An application
                  on a 2D synthetic data set, generated in a smooth
                  heterogeneous velocity model and with a complex
                  reflectivity, demonstrates the usefulness of
                  curvelets to predict what a migrated image would

                  the need for remigrating the full input data

                  compression of seismic data, their images, and the
                  imaging operator itself. We show that with
                  curvelets, the leading-order approximation (in
                  angular frequency, horizontal wavenumber, and
                  migrated location) to common-offset (CO) Kirchhoff
                  depth migration becomes a simple transformation of
                  coordinates of curvelets in the data, combined with
                  amplitude scaling. This transformation is calculated
                  using map migration, which employs the local slopes
                  from the curvelet decomposition of the data. Because
                  the data can be compressed using curvelets, the
                  transformation needs to be calculated for relatively
                  few curvelets only. Numerical examples for
                  homogeneous media show that using the leading-order
                  approximation only provides a good approximation to
                  CO migration for moderate propagation times. As the

  abstract = {Seismic signals are often irregularly sampled along
                  spatial coordinates, leading to suboptimal
                  processing and imaging results. Least-squares
                  estimation of Fourier components is used for the
                  reconstruction of band-limited seismic signals that
                  are irregularly sampled along two spatial
                  coordinates. A simple and efficient diagonal
                  weighting scheme, based on the areas surrounding the
                  spatial samples, takes the properties of the noise
                  (signal outside the bandwidth) into account in an
                  approximate sense. Diagonal stabilization based on
                  the energies of the signal and the noise ensures
                  robust estimation. Reconstruction by temporal
                  frequency component allows the specification of
                  varying bandwidth in two dimensions, depending on
                  the minimum apparent velocity. This parameterization
                  improves the reconstruction capability for lower
                  temporal frequencies. The shape of the spatial
                  aperture affects the method of sampling the Fourier
                  domain. Taking into account this property, a larger
                  bandwidth can be recovered. The properties of the
                  least-squares estimator allow a very efficient
                  implementation which, when using a conjugate
                  gradient algorithm, requires a modest number of 2-D
                  fast Fourier transforms per temporal frequency. The
                  method shows signicant improvement over the
                  conventionally used binning and stacking method on
                  both synthetic and real data. The method can be
                  applied to any subset of seismic data with two
                  varying spatial coordinates. {\copyright}2000

  abstract = {In 1992, Bamberger and Smith proposed the directional
                  filter bank (DFB) for an efficient directional
                  decomposition of 2-D signals. Due to the
                  nonseparable nature of the system, extending the DFB
                  to higher dimensions while still retaining its
                  attractive features is a challenging and previously
                  unsolved problem. We propose a new family of filter
                  banks, named NDFB, that can achieve the directional
                  decomposition of arbitrary N-dimensional (Nges2)
                  signals with a simple and efficient tree-structured
                  construction. In 3-D, the ideal passbands of the
                  proposed NDFB are rectangular-based pyramids
                  radiating out from the origin at different
                  orientations and tiling the entire frequency
                  space. The proposed NDFB achieves perfect
                  reconstruction via an iterated filter bank with a
                  redundancy factor of N in N-D. The angular
                  resolution of the proposed NDFB can be iteratively
                  refined by invoking more levels of decomposition
                  through a simple expansion rule. By combining the
                  NDFB with a new multiscale pyramid, we propose the
                  surfacelet transform, which can be used to
                  efficiently capture and represent surface-like
                  singularities in multidimensional data},

  volume = {65},
  pages = {426-436},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Frequency-domain shot-record migration can produce
                  higher quality images than Kirchhoff migration but
                  typically at a greater cost. The computing cost of
                  shot-record migration is the product of the number
                  of shots in the survey and the expense of each
                  individual migration. Many attempts to reduce this
                  cost have focused on the speed of the individual
                  migrations, trying to achieve a better trade-off
                  between accuracy and speed. Another approach is to
                  reduce the number of migrations. We investigate the
                  simultaneous migration of shot records using
                  frequency-domain shot-record migration algorithms.
                  The difficulty with this approach is the production
                  of so-called crossterms between unrelated shot and
                  receiver wavefields, which generate unwanted
                  artifacts or noise in the final image. To reduce
                  these artifacts and obtain an image comparable in
                  quality to the single-shot-per-migration result, we
                  have introduced a process called phase encoding,
                  which shifts or disperses these crossterms. The
                  process of phase encoding thus allows one to trade
                  S/N ratio for the speed of migrating the entire
                  survey. Several encoding functions and two
                  application strategies have been tested. The first
                  strategy, combining multiple shots per migration and
                  using each shot only once, reduces computation in
                  direct relation to the number of shots combined. The
                  second strategy, performing multiple migrations of
                  all the shots in the survey, provides a means to
                  reduce the crossterm noise by stacking the resulting
                  images. The additional noise in both strategies may
                  be tolerated if it is no stronger than the inherent
                  seismic noise in the migrated image and if the final
                  image is achieved with less cost. {\copyright}2000

  abstract = {We present an iterative nonparametric approach to
                  spectral estimation that is particularly suitable
                  for estimation of line spectra. This approach
                  minimizes a cost function derived from Bayes'
                  theorem. The method is suitable for line spectra
                  since a ``long tailed'' distribution is used to
                  model the prior distribution of spectral
                  amplitudes. An important aspect of this method is
                  that since the data themselves are used as
                  constraints, phase information can also be recovered
                  and used to extend the data outside the original
                  window. The objective function is formulated in
                  terms of hyperpa- rameters that control the degree
                  of fit and spectral resolution. Noise rejection can
                  also be achieved by truncating the number of
                  iterations. Spectral resolution and extrapolation
                  length are controlled by a single parameter. When
                  this parameter is large compared with the spectral
                  powers, the algorithm leads to zero extrapolation of
                  the data, and the estimated Fourier transform yields
                  the periodogram. When the data are sampled at a
                  constant rate, the algorithm uses one Levinson
                  recursion per iteration. For irregular sampling
                  (unevenly sampled and/or gapped data), the algorithm
                  uses one Cholesky decomposition per iteration. The
                  performance of the algorithm is illustrated with
                  three different problems that frequently arise in
                  geophysical data processing: 1) harmonic retrieval
                  from a time series contaminated with noise; 2)
                  linear event detection from a finite aperture array
                  of receivers [which, in fact, is an extension of
                  1)], 3) interpolation/extrapolation of gapped data.
                  The performance of the algorithm as a spectral
                  estimator is tested with the Kay and Marple data
                  set. It is shown that the achieved resolution is
                  comparable with parametric methods but with more
                  accurate representation of the relative power in the
                  spectral lines.},

  abstract = {Interpolation of seismic traces is an effective means of
                  improving migration when the data set exhibits
                  spatial aliasing. A major difficulty of standard
                  interpolation methods is that they depend on the
                  degree of reliability with which the various
                  geological events can be separated. In this respect,
                  a multichannel interpolation method is described
                  which requires neither a priori knowledge of the
                  directions of lateral coherence of the events, nor
                  estimation of these directions. The method is based
                  on the fact that linear events present in a section
                  made of equally spaced traces may be interpolated
                  exactly, regardless of the original spatial
                  interval, without any attempt to determine their
                  true dips. The predictability of linear events in
                  the f-x domain allows the missing traces to be
                  expressed as the output of a linear system, the
                  input of which consists of the recorded traces. The
                  interpolation operator is obtained by solving a set
                  of linear equations whose coefficients depend only
                  on the spectrum of the spatial prediction filter
                  defined by the recorded traces. Synthetic examples
                  show that this method is insensitive to random noise
                  and that it correctly handles curvatures and lateral
                  amplitude variations. Assessment of the method with
                  a real data set shows that the interpolation yields
                  an improved migrated section. {\copyright}1991

  abstract = {We describe approximate digital implementations of two
                  new mathematical transforms, namely, the ridgelet
                  transform and the curvelet transform. Our
                  implementations offer exact reconstruction,
                  stability against perturbations, ease of
                  implementation, and low computational complexity. A
                  central tool is Fourier-domain computation of an
                  approximate digital Radon transform. We introduce a
                  very simple interpolation in the Fourier space which
                  takes Cartesian samples and yields samples on a
                  rectopolar grid, which is a pseudo-polar sampling
                  set based on a concentric squares geometry. Despite
                  the crudeness of our interpolation, the visual
                  performance is surprisingly good. Our ridgelet
                  transform applies to the Radon transform a special
                  overcomplete wavelet pyramid whose wavelets have
                  compact support in the frequency domain. Our
                  curvelet transform uses our ridgelet transform as a
                  component step, and implements curvelet subbands
                  using a filter bank of a&grave; trous wavelet
                  filters. Our philosophy throughout is that
                  transforms should be overcomplete, rather than
                  critically sampled. We apply these digital
                  transforms to the denoising of some standard images
                  embedded in white noise. In the tests reported here,
                  simple thresholding of the curvelet coefficients is
                  very competitive with "state of the art" techniques
                  based on wavelets, including thresholding of
                  decimated or undecimated wavelet transforms and also
                  including tree-based Bayesian posterior mean
                  methods. Moreover, the curvelet reconstructions
                  exhibit higher perceptual quality than wavelet-based
                  reconstructions, offering visually sharper images
                  and, in particular, higher quality recovery of edges
                  and of faint linear and curvilinear
                  features. Existing theory for curvelet and ridgelet
                  transforms suggests that these new approaches can
                  outperform wavelet methods in certain image
                  reconstruction problems. The empirical results
                  reported here are in encouraging agreement},

  year = {2007},
  volume = {72},

  abstract = {Reverse time migration (RTM) requires that fields
                  computed in forward time be accessed in reverse
                  order. Such out-of-order access, to recursively
                  computed fields, requires that some part of the
                  recursion history be stored (checkpointed), with the
                  remainder computed by repeating parts of the forward
                  computation. Optimal checkpointing algorithms choose
                  checkpoints in such a way that the total storage is
                  minimized for a prescribed level of excess
                  computation, or vice versa. Optimal checkpointing
                  dramatically reduces the storage required by RTM,
                  compared to that needed for nonoptimal
                  implementations, at the price of a small increase in
                  computation. This paper describes optimal
                  checkpointing in a form which applies both to RTM
                  and other applications of the adjoint state method,

  abstract = {Normal moveout (NMO) and stacking, an important step in
                  analysis of reflection seismic data, involves
                  summation of seismic data over paths represented by
                  a family of hyperbolic curves. This summation
                  process is a linear transformation and maps the data
                  into what might be called a velocity space: a
                  two-dimensional set of points indexed by time and
                  velocity. Examination of data in velocity space is
                  used for analysis of subsurface velocities and
                  filtering of undesired coherent events (e.g.,
                  multiples), but the filtering step is useful only if
                  an approximate inverse to the NMO and stack
                  operation is available. One way to effect velocity
                  filtering is to use the operator LT (defined as NMO
                  and stacking) and its adjoint L as a transform pair,
                  but this leads to unacceptable filtered
                  output. Designing a better estimated inverse to L
                  than LT is a generalization of the inversion problem
                  of computerized tomography: deconvolving out the
                  point-spread function after back projection. The
                  inversion process is complicated by missing data,
                  because surface seismic data are recorded only
                  within a finite spatial aperture on the Earth's
                  surface.  Our approach to solving the problem of an
                  ill-conditioned or nonunique inverse L--1, brought
                  on by missing data, is to design a stochastic
                  inverse to L. Starting from a maximum a posteriori
                  (MAP) estimator, a system of equations can be set up
                  in which a priori information is incorporated into a
                  sparseness measure: the output of the stochastic
                  inverse is forced to be locally focused, in order to
                  obtain the best possible resolution in velocity
                  space. The size of the resulting nonlinear system of
                  equations is immense, but using a few iterations
                  with a gradient descent algorithm is adequate to
                  obtain a reasonable solution. This theory may also
                  be applied to other large, sparse linear
                  operators. The stochastic inverse of the slant-stack
                  operator (a particular form of the Radon transform),
                  can be developed in a parallel manner, and will
                  yield an accurate slant-stack inverse pair.

  abstract = {The Radon transform (RT) suffers from the typical
                  problems of loss of resolution and aliasing that
                  arise as a consequence of incomplete information,
                  including limited aperture and
                  discretization. Sparseness in the Radon domain is a
                  valid and useful criterion for supplying this
                  missing information, equivalent somehow to assuming
                  smooth amplitude variation in the transition between
                  known and unknown (missing) data. Applying this
                  constraint while honoring the data can become a
                  serious challenge for routine seismic processing
                  because of the very limited processing time
                  available, in general, per common midpoint. To
                  develop methods that are robust, easy to use and
                  flexible to adapt to different problems we have to
                  pay attention to a variety of algorithms, operator
                  design, and estimation of the hyperparameters that
                  are responsible for the regularization of the
                  solution.In this paper, we discuss fast
                  implementations for several varieties of RT in the
                  time and frequency domains. An iterative conjugate
                  gradient algorithm with fast Fourier transform
                  multiplication is used in all cases. To preserve the
                  important property of iterative subspace methods of
                  regularizing the solution by the number of
                  iterations, the model weights are incorporated into
                  the operators. This turns out to be of particular
                  importance, and it can be understood in terms of the
                  singular vectors of the weighted transform. The
                  iterative algorithm is stopped according to a
                  general cross validation criterion for subspaces. We
                  apply this idea to several known implementations and
                  compare results in order to better understand
                  differences between, and merits of, these

  abstract = {A surface-related multiple-elimination method can be
                  formulated as an iterative procedure: the output of
                  one iteration step is used as input for the next
                  iteration step (part I of this paper). In this paper
                  (part II) it is shown that the procedure can be made
                  very efficient if a good initial estimate of the
                  multiple-free data set can be provided in the first
                  iteration, and in many situations, the Radon-based
                  multiple-elimination method may provide such an
                  estimate. It is also shown that for each iteration,
                  the inverse source wavelet can be accurately
                  estimated by a linear (least-squares) inversion
                  process. Optionally, source and detector variations
                  and directivity effects can be included, although
                  the examples are given without these options. The
                  iterative multiple elimination process, together
                  with the source wavelet estimation, are illustrated
                  with numerical experiments as well as with field
                  data examples. The results show that the
                  surface-related multiple-elimination process is very
                  effective in time gates where the moveout properties
                  of primaries and multiples are very similar
                  (generally deep data), as well as for situations
                  with a complex multiple-generating system.

  abstract = {Seismic data regularization, which spatially transforms
                  irregularly sampled acquired data to regularly
                  sampled data, is a long-standing problem in seismic
                  data processing. Data regularization can be
                  implemented using Fourier theory by using a method
                  that estimates the spatial frequency content on an
                  irregularly sampled grid. The data can then be
                  reconstructed on any desired grid. Difficulties
                  arise from the nonorthogonality of the global
                  Fourier basis functions on an irregular grid, which
                  results in the problem of "spectral leakage": energy
                  from one Fourier coefficient leaks onto others. We
                  investigate the nonorthogonality of the Fourier
                  basis on an irregularly sampled grid and propose a
                  technique called "antileakage Fourier transform" to
                  overcome the spectral leakage. In the antileakage
                  Fourier transform, we first solve for the most
                  energetic Fourier coefficient, assuming that it
                  causes the most severe leakage. To attenuate all
                  aliases and the leakage of this component onto other
                  Fourier coefficients, the data component
                  corresponding to this most energetic Fourier
                  coefficient is subtracted from the original input on
                  the irregular grid. We then use this new input to
                  solve for the next Fourier coefficient, repeating
                  the procedure until all Fourier coefficients are
                  estimated. This procedure is equivalent to
                  "reorthogonalizing" the global Fourier basis on an
                  irregularly sampled grid. We demonstrate the
                  robustness and effectiveness of this technique with
                  successful applications to both synthetic and real
                  data examples. {\copyright}2005 Society of

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the first 3D discrete curvelet
                  transform. This transform is an extension to the 2D
                  transform described in Candes et al..1 The resulting
                  curvelet frame preserves the important properties,
                  such as parabolic scaling, tightness and sparse
                  representation for singularities of codimension
                  one. We describe three different implementations:
                  in-core, out-of-core and MPI-based parallel
                  implementations. Numerical results verify the
                  desired properties of the 3D curvelets and
                  demonstrate the efficiency of our implementations.},
