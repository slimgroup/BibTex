  title = {InvertibleNetworks.jl: A Julia package for scalable normalizing flows},
  year = {2023},
  month = {12},
  abstract = {InvertibleNetworks.jl is a Julia package designed for the scalable implementation of normalizing flows, a method for density estimation and sampling in high-dimensional distributions. This package excels in memory efficiency by leveraging the inherent invertibility of normalizing flows, which significantly reduces memory requirements during backpropagation compared to existing normalizing flow packages that rely on automatic differentiation frameworks. InvertibleNetworks.jl has been adapted for diverse applications, including seismic imaging, medical imaging, and CO2 monitoring, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning high-dimensional distributions.},

  title = {WISE: full-Waveform variational Inference via Subsurface Extensions},
  year = {2023},
  month = {12},
  abstract = {We introduce a probabilistic technique for full-waveform inversion, employing variational inference and conditional normalizing flows to quantify uncertainty in migration-velocity models and its impact on imaging. Our approach integrates generative artificial intelligence with physics-informed common-image gathers, reducing reliance on accurate initial velocity models. Considered case studies demonstrate its efficacy producing realizations of migration-velocity models conditioned by the data. These models are used to quantify amplitude and positioning effects during subsequent imaging.},
