  abstract = {Modern-day reservoir management and monitoring of geological carbon storage increasingly call for costly time-lapse seismic data collection. In this letter, we show how techniques from graph theory can be used to optimize acquisition geometries for low-cost sparse 4D seismic. Based on midpoint-offset domain connectivity arguments, the proposed algorithm automatically produces sparse non-replicated time-lapse acquisition geometries that favor wavefield recovery.},

  title = {Model-Parallel Fourier Neural Operators as Learned Surrogates for Large-Scale Parametric PDEs},
  year = {2022},
  month = {04},
  abstract = {Fourier neural operators (FNOs) are a recently introduced neural network architecture for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), which have been shown to perform significantly better than comparable deep learning approaches. Once trained, FNOs can achieve speed-ups of multiple orders of magnitude over conventional numerical PDE solvers. However, due to the high dimensionality of their input data and network weights, FNOs have so far only been applied to two-dimensional or small three-dimensional problems. To remove this limited problem-size barrier, we propose a model-parallel version of FNOs based on domain-decomposition of both the input data and network weights. We demonstrate that our model-parallel FNO is able to predict time-varying PDE solutions of over 2.6 billion variables on Perlmutter using up to 512 A100 GPUs and show an example of training a distributed FNO on the Azure cloud for simulating multiphase CO2 dynamics in the Earth's subsurface.},

  title = {Reliable amortized variational inference with physics-based latent distribution correction},
  year = {2022},
  month = {07},
  abstract = {Bayesian inference for high-dimensional inverse problems is
challenged by the computational costs of the forward operator and the
selection of an appropriate prior distribution. Amortized variational
inference addresses these challenges where a neural network is trained to
approximate the posterior distribution over existing pairs of model and data.
When fed previously unseen data and normally distributed latent samples as
input, the pretrained deep neural network---in our case a conditional
normalizing flow---provides posterior samples with virtually no cost.
However, the accuracy of this approach relies on the availability of
high-fidelity training data, which seldom exists in geophysical inverse
problems because of the highly heterogeneous structure of the Earth. In
addition, accurate amortized variational inference requires the observed data
to be drawn from the training data distribution. As such, we offer a solution
that increases the resilience of amortized variational inference when faced
with data distribution shifts, e.g., changes in the forward model or prior
distribution. Our method involves a physics-based correction to the
conditional normalizing flow latent distribution to provide a more accurate
approximation to the posterior distribution for the observed data at hand. To
accomplish this, instead of a standard Gaussian latent distribution, we
parameterize the latent distribution by a Gaussian distribution with an
unknown mean and diagonal covariance. These unknown quantities are then
estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the corrected
and true posterior distributions. While generic and applicable to other
inverse problems, by means of a seismic imaging example, we show that our
correction step improves the robustness of amortized variational inference
with respect to changes in number of source experiments, noise variance, and
shifts in the prior distribution. This approach provides a seismic image with
limited artifacts and an assessment of its uncertainty with approximately the
same cost as five reverse-time migrations.},
