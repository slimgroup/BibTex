  abstract = {By building on recent advances in the use of randomized trace
estimation to drastically reduce the memory footprint of adjoint-state
methods, we present and validate an imaging approach that can be executed
exclusively on accelerators. Results obtained on field-realistic synthetic
datasets, which include salt and anisotropy, show that our method produces
high-fidelity images. These findings open the enticing perspective of 3D
wave-based inversion technology with a memory footprint that matches the
hardware and that runs exclusively on clusters of GPUs without the
undesirable need to offload certain tasks to CPUs.},

  title = {Deep Bayesian inference for seismic imaging with tasks},
  year = {2021},
  month = {10},
  abstract = {We propose to use techniques from Bayesian inference and deep
neural networks to translate uncertainty in seismic imaging to uncertainty in
tasks performed on the image, such as horizon tracking. Seismic imaging is an
ill-posed inverse problem because of unavoidable bandwidth and aperture
limitations, which that is hampered by the presence of noise and
linearization errors. Many regularization methods, such as transform-domain
sparsity promotion, have been designed to deal with the adverse effects of
these errors, however, these methods run the risk of biasing the solution and
do not provide information on uncertainty in the image space and how this
uncertainty impacts certain tasks on the image. A systematic approach is
proposed to translate uncertainty due to noise in the data to confidence
intervals of automatically tracked horizons in the image. The uncertainty is
characterized by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and to assess these
uncertainties, samples are drawn from the posterior distribution of the CNN
weights, used to parameterize the image. Compared to traditional priors, in
the literature it is argued that these CNNs introduce a flexible inductive
bias that is a surprisingly good fit for many diverse domains in imaging. The
method of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics is employed to sample from
the posterior distribution. This method is designed to handle large scale
Bayesian inference problems with computationally expensive forward operators
as in seismic imaging. Aside from offering a robust alternative to maximum a
posteriori estimate that is prone to overfitting, access to these samples
allow us to translate uncertainty in the image, due to noise in the data, to
uncertainty on the tracked horizons. For instance, it admits estimates for
the pointwise standard deviation on the image and for confidence intervals on
its automatically tracked horizons.},

  title = {Low-memory stochastic backpropagation with multi-channel randomized trace estimation},
  year = {2021},
  month = {06},
  abstract = {Thanks to the combination of state-of-the-art accelerators and highly
optimized open software frameworks, there has been tremendous progress in
the performance of deep neural networks. While these developments have
been responsible for many breakthroughs, progress towards solving large-scale
problems, such as video encoding and semantic segmentation in 3D,
is hampered because access to on-premise memory is often limited.
Instead of relying on (optimal) checkpointing or invertibility of the
network layers---to recover the activations during backpropagation---we
propose to approximate the gradient of convolutional layers in neural
networks with a multi-channel randomized trace estimation technique. Compared
to other methods, this approach is simple, amenable to analyses, and leads to a
greatly reduced memory footprint. Even though the randomized trace
estimation introduces stochasticity during training, we argue that this
is of little consequence as long as the induced errors are of the same
order as errors in the gradient due to the use of stochastic gradient
descent. We discuss the performance of networks trained with stochastic
backpropagation and how the error can be controlled while maximizing
memory usage and minimizing computational overhead.},

  title = {Graph Spectrum Based Seismic Survey Design},
  year = {2020},
  month = {12},
  abstract = {Randomized sampling techniques have become increasingly useful in seismic data acquisition and processing, allowing practitioners to achieve dense wavefield reconstruction from a substantially reduced number of field samples. However, typical designs studied in the low-rank matrix recovery and compressive sensing literature are difficult to achieve by standard industry hardware. For practical purposes, a compromise between stochastic and realizable samples is needed. In this paper, we propose a deterministic and computationally cheap tool to alleviate randomized acquisition design, prior to survey deployment and large-scale optimization. We consider universal and deterministic matrix completion results in the context of seismology, where a bipartite graph representation of the source-receiver layout allows for the respective spectral gap to act as a quality metric for wavefield reconstruction. We provide realistic survey design scenarios to demonstrate the utility of the spectral gap for successful seismic data acquisition via low-rank and sparse signal recovery.},

  title = {Large scale high-frequency wavefield reconstruction with recursively weighted matrix factorizations},
  year = {2020},
  month = {10},
  abstract = {Acquiring seismic data on a regular periodic fine grid is challenging. By exploiting the low-rank approximation property of fully sampled seismic data in some transform domain, low-rank matrix completion offers a scalable way to reconstruct seismic data on a regular periodic fine grid from coarsely randomly sampled data acquired in the field. While wavefield reconstruction have been applied successfully at the lower end of the spectrum, its performance deteriorates at the higher frequencies where the low-rank assumption no longer holds rendering this type of wavefield reconstruction ineffective in situations where high resolution images are desired. We overcome this shortcoming by exploiting similarities between adjacent frequency slices explicitly. During low-rank matrix factorization, these similarities translate to alignment of subspaces of the factors, a notion we propose to employ as we reconstruct monochromatic frequency slices recursively starting at the low frequencies. While this idea is relatively simple in its core, to turn this recent insight into a successful scalable wavefield reconstruction scheme for 3D seismic requires a number of important steps. First, we need to move the weighting matrices, which encapsulate the prior information from adjacent frequency slices, from the objective to the data misfit constraint. This move considerably improves the performance of the weighted low-rank matrix factorization on which our wavefield reconstructions is based. Secondly, we introduce approximations that allow us to decouple computations on a row-by-row and column-by-column basis, which in turn allow to parallelize the alternating optimization on which our low-rank factorization relies. The combination of weighting and decoupling leads to a computationally feasible full-azimuth wavefield reconstruction scheme that scales to industry-scale problem sizes. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed parallel algorithm on a 2D field data and on a 3D synthetic dataset. In both cases our approach produces high-fidelity broadband wavefield reconstructions from severely subsampled data.},

  title = {Lossy Checkpoint Compression in Full Waveform Inversion},
  year = {2020},
  month = {9},
  abstract = {This paper proposes a new method that combines check-pointing
methods with error-controlled lossy compression for large-scale
high-performance Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI), an inverse problem commonly
used in geophysical exploration. This combination can significantly reduce
data movement, allowing a reduction in run time as well as peak memory. In
the Exascale computing era, frequent data transfer (e.g., memory bandwidth,
PCIe bandwidth for GPUs, or network) is the performance bottleneck rather
than the peak FLOPS of the processing unit. Like many other adjoint-based
optimization problems, FWI is costly in terms of the number of floating-point
operations, large memory footprint during backpropagation, and data transfer
overheads. Past work for adjoint methods has developed checkpointing methods
that reduce the peak memory requirements during backpropagation at the cost
of additional floating-point computations. Combining this traditional
checkpointing with error-controlled lossy compression, we explore the
three-way tradeoff between memory, precision, and time to solution. We
investigate how approximation errors introduced by lossy compression of the
forward solution impact the objective function gradient and final inverted
solution. Empirical results from these numerical experiments indicate that
high lossy-compression rates (compression factors ranging up to 100) have a
relatively minor impact on convergence rates and the quality of the final
solution.},
