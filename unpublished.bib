  title = {De-risking Carbon Capture and Sequestration with Explainable CO2 Leakage Detection in Time-lapse Seismic Monitoring Images},
  year = {2022},

  abstract = {With the growing global deployment of carbon capture and
sequestration technology to combat climate change, monitor-
ing and detection of potential CO2 leakage through existing
or storage induced faults are critical to the safe and long-term
viability of the technology. Recent work on time-lapse seis-
mic monitoring of CO2 storage has shown promising results
in its ability to monitor the growth of the CO2 plume from
surface recorded seismic data. However, due to the low sen-
sitivity of seismic imaging to CO2 concentration, additional
developments are required to efficiently interpret the seis-
mic images for leakage. In this work, we introduce a binary
classification of time-lapse seismic images to delineate CO2
plumes (leakage) using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
Additionally, we localize the leakage region of CO2 plumes
by leveraging Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods.},

  title = {Reliable amortized variational inference with physics-based latent distribution correction},
  year = {2022},
  month = {07},
  abstract = {Bayesian inference for high-dimensional inverse problems is
challenged by the computational costs of the forward operator and the
selection of an appropriate prior distribution. Amortized variational
inference addresses these challenges where a neural network is trained to
approximate the posterior distribution over existing pairs of model and data.
When fed previously unseen data and normally distributed latent samples as
input, the pretrained deep neural network---in our case a conditional
normalizing flow---provides posterior samples with virtually no cost.
However, the accuracy of this approach relies on the availability of
high-fidelity training data, which seldom exists in geophysical inverse
problems because of the highly heterogeneous structure of the Earth. In
addition, accurate amortized variational inference requires the observed data
to be drawn from the training data distribution. As such, we offer a solution
that increases the resilience of amortized variational inference when faced
with data distribution shifts, e.g., changes in the forward model or prior
distribution. Our method involves a physics-based correction to the
conditional normalizing flow latent distribution to provide a more accurate
approximation to the posterior distribution for the observed data at hand. To
accomplish this, instead of a standard Gaussian latent distribution, we
parameterize the latent distribution by a Gaussian distribution with an
unknown mean and diagonal covariance. These unknown quantities are then
estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the corrected
and true posterior distributions. While generic and applicable to other
inverse problems, by means of a seismic imaging example, we show that our
correction step improves the robustness of amortized variational inference
with respect to changes in number of source experiments, noise variance, and
shifts in the prior distribution. This approach provides a seismic image with
limited artifacts and an assessment of its uncertainty with approximately the
same cost as five reverse-time migrations.},
