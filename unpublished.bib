  abstract = {Thanks to continued performance improvements in software and
hardware, wave-equation based imaging technologies, such full-waveform
inversion and reverse-time migration, are becoming more common place.
However, wide-spread adaptation of these advanced imaging modalities has not
yet materialized because current implementations are not able to reap the
full benefits from accelerators, in particular those offered by memory-scarce
graphics processing units. Through the use of randomized trace estimation, we
overcome the memory bottleneck of this type of hardware. At the cost of
limited computational overhead and controllable incoherent errors in the
gradient, the memory footprint of adjoint-state methods is reduced
drastically. Thanks to this relatively simple to implement memory reduction
via an approximate imaging condition, we are able to benefit from graphics
processing units without memory offloading. We demonstrate the performance of
the proposed algorithm on acoustic 2- and 3-D full-waveform inversion
examples and on the formation of image gathers in transverse tilted isotropic
media.},
