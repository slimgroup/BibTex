  title = {Time-lapse full-waveform permeability inversion: a feasibility study},
  year = {2024},
  month = {3},
  abstract = {Time-lapse seismic monitoring necessitates integrated workflows that combine seismic and reservoir modeling to enhance reservoir property estimation. We present a feasibility study of an end-to-end inversion framework that directly inverts for permeability from prestack time-lapse seismic data. To assess the method’s robustness, we design experiments focusing on its sensitivity to initial models and potential errors in modeling. Our study leverages the Compass model to simulate CO2 storage in saline aquifers, which is derived from well and seismic data from the North Sea, a candidate site for geological carbon storage.},

  title = {DT4GCS --- Digital Twin for Geological CO2 Storage and Control},
  year = {2024},
  month = {2},
  abstract = {Our industry is experiencing significant changes due to AI and the challenges of the energy transition. While some view these changes as threats, recent advances in AI offer unique opportunities, especially in the context of Digital Twins for subsurface monitoring and control. IBM defines “A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision-making.” During this talk, we will explore these concepts and their significance in addressing the challenges of monitoring and control of geological CO2 storage projects. This talk also aims to illustrate how Digital Twins can serve as a platform to integrate the seemingly disparate and siloed fields of geophysics and reservoir engineering.},

  title = {InvertibleNetworks.jl: A Julia package for scalable normalizing flows},
  year = {2023},
  month = {12},
  abstract = {InvertibleNetworks.jl is a Julia package designed for the scalable implementation of normalizing flows, a method for density estimation and sampling in high-dimensional distributions. This package excels in memory efficiency by leveraging the inherent invertibility of normalizing flows, which significantly reduces memory requirements during backpropagation compared to existing normalizing flow packages that rely on automatic differentiation frameworks. InvertibleNetworks.jl has been adapted for diverse applications, including seismic imaging, medical imaging, and CO2 monitoring, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning high-dimensional distributions.},

  year = {2023},
  month = {12},
  abstract = {We introduce a probabilistic technique for full-waveform inversion, employing variational inference and conditional normalizing flows to quantify uncertainty in migration-velocity models and its impact on imaging. Our approach integrates generative artificial intelligence with physics-informed common-image gathers, reducing reliance on accurate initial velocity models. Considered case studies demonstrate its efficacy producing realizations of migration-velocity models conditioned by the data. These models are used to quantify amplitude and positioning effects during subsequent imaging.},
